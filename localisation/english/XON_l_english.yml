# Country Name Stuff
 XON:0 "Xiongnu Confederation"
 XON_DEF:0 "Xiongnu Confederation"
 XRU_ADJ:0 "Xiongnu"

# Leader Stuff
XON_KHAN:0 "KHAN"
XON_KHAN_desc:0 "All khanates bow to one Khan. That is the rule in Xiongnu. The nomadic people of the north have decided that no one person is mighty enough to rule for all khanates - and so now they bow to what they call the greatest khan to grace the earth. This khan is, of course, a computer."

# Idea Stuff
XON_unhappy_chinese:0 "Unhappy Chinese"
XON_unhappy_chinese_desc:0 "The Chinese within Xiongnu have no reason to worship a mechanical monstrosity, nor endure the constant favoring the machine has towards nomads. If KHAN cannot accomodate Chinese farmers, then it may not be accomodated by them for much longer either."
XON_tuvan_separatism:0 "Tuvan Separatism"
XON_tuvan_separatism_desc:0 "Tuva was the only Khanate to refuse to bow to the KHAN, and had to be conquered with force instead. However, the KHAN fails to understand that forces in the shadows have ensured that Tuva was never truly conquered - simply waiting for an opportune time for its newest leader to take revenge."

# Focus Stuff
XON_a_thousand_blessings:0 "A Thousand Blessings"
XON_a_thousand_blessings_desc:0 "A thousand blessings upon our great KHAN. The KHAN has ruled the Confederation of 6 since its inception, and the KHAN is wise and benevolent. No man could accomplish such a thing - only a being beyond our comprehension, beyond our feeble morals and strength. KHAN is all of that and more."
XON_loyal_and_true:0 "The Loyal and True"
XON_loyal_and_true_desc:0 "Many in Xiongnu remain loyal and true to our great KHAN. We have brought together a vast array of people in the hope that we can accomplish, under KHAN, something that only one man had ever done."
XON_the_sworn_enemy:0 "The Sworn Enemy"
XON_the_sworn_enemy_desc:0 "Those in the west have no loyalty to the KHAN. They are more than just foreigners - they are outsiders, desiring to conquer a land that was never theirs to begin with. The Confederation as a whole will have something to say of that."

# Event Stuff
XON.start_1.t:0 "The 15th Council on Xiongnu Affairs"
XON.start_1.d:0 "The 15th Council silently shuffled into the room where the representative was waiting. After the incident last month, the KHAN had been moved to an undisclosed location. No longer could the council members pick up the phone directly to hear the KHAN's thoughts - instead, they would have to settle for a wired line. As the meeting slowly droned on, the Tuvan council member sat with his head in his hands. The KHAN was doing very little but saying 'NO' to every proposition the council members made. Change did not matter so much elsewhere, but if it failed to happen in Tuva..."
XON.start_1.a:0 "...Things might change themselves."

XON.start_2.t:0 "Our Great KHAN"
XON.start_2.d:0 "The prayer had been mandated a couple of years prior for all humans within the Confederation, and nobody was in a rush to disobey the KHAN. Silently, families eating their dinners would give thanks to the glorious KHAN for bringing the Khanates together and creating peace and prosperity. They may not have really been prospering, but they were not suffering, so they were none the wiser."
XON.start_2.a:0 "One KHAN, Many Peoples!"

XON.start_3.t:0 "Villainy in the West"
XON.start_3.d:0 "KHAN had always had a great wisdom when it came to seeing humans who had little regard for others, and the Ottomans fit that bill perfectly. In the mind of KHAN, it was obvious that Xiongnu and the Ottoman Sultanate simply could not coexist."
XON.start_3.a:0 "A self-fulfilling prophecy, for better or worse."
