XHP_crusader_crisis_desc:0 "The Order of Santiago, originally known as the Order of Saint James of the Sword, is one of the most renowned chivalric orders in Spain. Founded in the 12th century during the Reconquista, the period in which Christian kingdoms sought to retake the Iberian Peninsula from Islamic rule.\n\nInitially established as a religious and military institution, the Order of Santiago attracted noble knights who pledged their allegiance to defend the Christian faith and territories. Over time, it evolved into a powerful organization with vast landholdings and significant political influence.\n\nNow they serve as a political behemoth heavily influencing the politics of the Imperial Court while draining the little political power that it has. In the recent weeks, the Holy Order has begun organizing its forces independent from government operations..."

XHP_senate:0 "Corte Imperial"
XHP_senate_desc:0 "The "Corte Imperial" or Imperial Court, is the legislative body that rules whats left of the Spanish State. Founded in 2025 as a result of the dropping of the bombs, the Imperial Court serves as all three branches of government including executive, legislative, and judiccial powers within the Spanish State.\n\nDue to its relative neutrality, advantagous geography, and hasty preparations, the countryside of Spain was mostly spared and the population was able to thrive underground. However, due to the overpopulation of the underground societies and the mismanagement by the government, many died due to malnutrition and starvation, forcing the government to expand back upwards into the wastelands.\n\nNot being prepared for what was to come on the surface, the central government was quickly stretched to its limits and was forced to abandon many surface outposts, leading to a drastic shrinkage of territory, manpower, and resources.\n\nMany saw this weakness as an opportunity to vie for power within the Court, causing a majority of the power of the government to lie within the corrupt Court Leaders and their families.\n\nNow, lying on the precipice for disaster as the Catholic-led Order of Santiago mobilizes its forces, the government must make concessions to this cultist group or face a civil war. A civil war, that the government will most likely not win..."
XHP_high_council:0 "Templaric High Council"
XHP_high_council_desc:0 "The Order of Santiago is a religious and military order founded in the 12th century. It owes its name to the patron saint of Spain, Santiago (St. James the Greater). Its initial objective was to protect the pilgrims on the Way of St. James, to defend Christendom and to remove the Muslim Moors from the Iberian Peninsula with the Reconquista. Entrance was not restricted to nobility of Spain exclusively, and some members have been Catholic Europeans from other parts of Europe.\n\nAt the timing of the fall of the bombs, the Order was at its weakest, having less than 100 members. However, through the course of living underground, the order started to amass a larger following as it provided a structure on how to live admist the chaos and violence that plagued the Imperial Court.\n\nToday it serves as one of the most powerful political identities within the Spanish government with thousands of followers from all across Spain. It serves as a bastion of stability and prosperity amongst the corrupt beauracracy that is the Spanish government."
