 XLA_Elders_Council:0 "The Council of Arnmouth"
 XLA_Elders_Council_desc:0 "The Council of Arnmouth is a instititution that has lasted since the founding of the Lost Tribes in the early 2100s. A uniting force, the Council of Elders consists of 2 representatives from each region as well as 1 from the Capital. However, the council has recently begun to divide itself, and the future of the Lost Tribes is uncertain."
 XLA_Altwigitian_Revolutionaries:0 "Altwigitian Revolutionaries"
 XLA_Altwigitian_Revolutionaries_desc:0 "Despising the direction of the nation, with the Spiritualists gaining too much power, the Altwigitians and their supporters have begun to form revolutionary bands, refusing to support the Councils government until appeasements have been made, or the current support of the Spiritualists comes to an end."
 XLA_Altwigitian_Revolutionaries_Crushed:0 "Altwigitian Revolutionaries Dispersed"
 XLA_Altwigitian_Revolutionaries_Crushed_desc:0 "With the might of the Arnmouthian Armed forces, the revolutionary bands of the Altwigitians have been dispersed. While some still remain within the depths of the nation, the most outspoken ones have become silenced. Peace is no longer an option, and further action must be taken to elimiate them completely."

 XLA_Naval_Aversion:0 "Naval Aversion"
 XLA_Naval_Aversion_desc:0 "Throughout the Lost Tribes history, attempts to conquer the sea have been futile. For a century, we have tried to go beyond our shores only for our valiant men and women to fall victim to the gods of the Sea. Storms have battered our coastal cities, with our coastal defensive wall at Auctermunty now crumbling."
 XLA_Aero_Aversion:0 "Aerial Aversion"
 XLA_Aero_Aversion_desc:0 "The Lost Tribes, while having faced ruin at sea, has yet to accept aerial traversion. While some at the Kammora School of Transmutation believe that teleportation through the skies is possible, the vast majority of Arnmouthians believe that flight is relegated to those who were born to reach the heavens. Simply creating the technology will not allow the population to accept it, but discussion and education as well."

 # Decisions
  regional_balance_gui_decision_category:0 "The Council of Arnmouth§!"
  regional_balance_gui_decision_category_desc:0 "Within Arnmouth, there exist 3 major factions. The £XLA_neutral_texticon §8Neutrals§!, the £XLA_spiritualist_texticon §GSpiritualists§!, and the £XLA_altwigitian_texticon §1Altwigitians§!. They co-exist within a delicate balance of power within the Council. The Council of Arnmouth consists of 2 members from each region, as well as 1 from the Capital region Auctermunty. Each member, or elder, aligns with one of these factions, but may be tempted to any side for a cost. \n\nCurrently, the Council of Arnmouth consists of the following. \n\n £XLA_neutral_texticon §8[?XLA_Neutral_Councilmembers] Neutrals§! \n\n £XLA_spiritualist_texticon §G[?XLA_Spiritualist_Councilmembers] Spirutalists§! \n\n £XLA_altwigitian_texticon §1[?XLA_Altwigitian_Councilmembers] Altwigitians§! \n\nHow the future of the nation unfolds remains in the hands of the council, and whoever can maintain a majority will rule the nation in whatever way they see fit."
