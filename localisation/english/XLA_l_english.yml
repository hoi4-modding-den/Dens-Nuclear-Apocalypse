They co-exist within a delicate balance of power within the Council. The Council of Arnmouth consists of 2 members from each region, as well as 1 from the Capital region Auctermunty. Each member, or elder, aligns with one of these factions, but may be tempted to any side for a cost. \n\nCurrently, the Council of Arnmouth consists of the following. \n\n§W[?XLA_Neutral_Councilmembers] Neutrals§! \n\n§G[?XLA_Spiritualist_Councilmembers] Spirutalists§! \n\n§1[?XLA_Altwigitian_Councilmembers] Altwigitians§! \n\nHow the future of the nation unfolds remains in the hands of the council, and whoever can maintain a majority will rule the nation in whatever way they see fit."
