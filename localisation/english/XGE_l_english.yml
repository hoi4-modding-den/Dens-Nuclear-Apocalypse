 XGE_erich_honecker_desc:0 "The 'Kybernetik Betriebssystem', or The Cybernetic Operating System as it's known in English, is a computer program that was discovered five years ago from the rubbles that once was Berlin, pre-installed to a computer from the 1980's that was found alongside it. The Operating System is very archaic, merely consisting of a simple terminal input and the face of the long-forgotten East German dictator Erich Honecker. Typing in to the terminal and sending it will yield a response from Honecker to whatever the user had typed in. This piece of technology has formed an entire following around it, with millions of people following a computer's orders with no hesitation or further questions."

Ideologically, the SUPNG leadership merely follows the commands and wishes of the Operating System, which has lead to the nation closely resembling a Cold War-era Marxist-Leninist state."

 XGE_intro_loc:0 "After the bombs had begun to fall all those years ago, it was evident that Germany would never be the same again, not just because of the nuclear hellfire that was unleashed upon the world, but because of the failure of the liberal democratic government to protect its people it had once sworn to defend from conflict. All credibility of the systems of the old times vanished alongside the many people that died in the most devastating conflict known to mankind, leading to the survivors turning towards demagogues advertising them about ideologies that were more and more lunatic than before, ideologies that swore to turn the mere ruins of the once prospering German nation to something better, something that couldn't be destroyed so easily...\n\nMaximillian Weiß was one of those people who wanted to rebuild what was once lost in a mere matter of seconds. He was the one who discovered the Kybernetik Betriebssystem from the rubbles of old Berlin, a computer program that begun to guide him and the people around it, seemigly enchanting them with promises of economic prosperity and egletarianism. It seemed that the machine knew better than the so-called humane leaders that had once ruled them, the Operating System clearly being programmed to make decisions that seemed to only benefit humanity.\n\n§HCurrent Content:§! \n\n §G-Rebuild the devastated German society.\n -Realize a Neo-German Democratic Republic.\n -Reunify the nation under the§! §6Kybernetik Betriebssystem.§!"
