### HISTORY

XTW_history:0 "Despite being the shining beacon of democracy in East Asia following the downfall of Laos, Taiwan is not excused from its own set of problems.\n\nKuomintang, perpetrators of the failed coup attempt in early 23th century, roam the mountains, and their influence on the population continues to rise as dissatisfaction of the government grows.\n\nThere is also the matter of overpopulation. Taiwan was minimally affected by the nuclear fallout, and its population continued to thrive when the rest of China suffered. However, this luxury came with an eventual cost."
