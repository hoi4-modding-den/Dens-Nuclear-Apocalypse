Bombs devastated §YChongqing§! and the human inhabitants §Rdied over months of radiation poisioning§!.\n\nNothing remained. Yet out of the ash and rubble emerged the §Oautomatons§!, guided by remaining §Ysynthetic intelligence algorithms§!. The remaining §Oautomatons§! attempted to recreate the governmental systems of old but failed, ultimately creating their own system of governance §Ysynthetic absolution§!. A period of industrial advancement followed the creation of the §OAutomaton Union§!. §CFactories were restored to their pre-war efficiency and old automatons were repaired daily§!.\n\nThis era of bliss was not to last as the automatons began to run out of §Ycomponents§! to repair and maintain themselves. Only through the efforts of the AI known as §R'Rogue'§! was the Union saved.
