 XGE_erich_honecker_desc:0 "The 'Kybernetik Betriebssystem', or The Cybernetic Operating System as it's known in English, is a computer program that was discovered five years ago from the rubbles that one was Berlin, pre-installed to a computer from the 1980's that was found alongside it. The Operating System is very archaic, merely consisting of a simple terminal input and the face of the long-forgotten East German dictator Erich Honecker. Typing in to the terminal and sending it will yield a response from Honecker to whatever the user had typed in. This piece of technology has formed an entire following around it, with millions of people following a computer's orders with no hesitation or further questions."

 XGE_stalinism_desc:0 "Headed by a Cybernetic Operating System mimicking the late Erich Honecker, the Neo-German Reconstructive Authority is one of the few centralized states that have risen from the ashes of the Nuclear Apocalypse. Ideologically, the SUPNG leadership merely follows the commands and wishes of the Operating System, which has lead to the nation closely resembling a Cold War-era Marxist-Leninist state."
