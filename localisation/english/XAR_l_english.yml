 XAR_history_desc:0 "The anarchy in Northern Spain was ceaseless with rival gangs fighting over control of resources. This would come to an end when a pretty unknown gang in Sarayosa discovered a pre-apocalypse bunker, filled to the brim with military technology built to survive for years by the long gone Spanish Government. Thanks to this newfound military tech, newly-declared Sarayosan Armed Forces swept west into Boros and Baladid under the guise of liberating the people from the anarchy. This liberation entrailing high quotas for the protection of the defence authority. Serrano now stands tall over thousands of people in his own personal empire, although this soon might change with the populace growing restless."

 XAR_valer_serrano_desc:0 "Valer Serrano is the highest ranking general in the peninsula with over 200 medals for his unmatched courage as the leader of the Militarized Defence Authority of Sarayosa. Coming from a "long bloodline of 'Panish generals" to explain his military victories and honor.\n\nIn truth however, much of his life was spent in Sarayosa slums as a leader of a minor gang that spent most of its time stealing water bottles from the public. Serrano's gang struck gold when they came across a sealed military depot from pre-nuclear times. With this newfound military tech, newly-declared Sarayosan Armed Forces swept west into Boros and Baladid. The people in these new territories at first welcomed the defence authority. Which wouldnt last long after learning that they needed to pay high quotas for the protection of the defence authority or get deported into the anarchic areas.\n\nSerrano now stands tall over the state, using the resources for further expansion of the military or maybe a nice new car. The people will have to see if his promise of bringing stability will hold up."

 XAR_increasing_civil_discontent_name_desc:0 "Sarayosa Defence Authority was founded upon the idea of protecting the people from the chaos of anarchy by...questionable military personal to say the least. However, the people can no longer stand blind to the appropriation of their resources going nowhere, having their livelihoods taken for less-than-average living conditions. All of this while a shady promise of "Permanent Peace" that never comes. If Serrano doesnt deal with this situation, his tinpot empire will soon collapse."

 XAR_quest_for_eternal_peace_name_desc:0 "Who wouldnt love peace? In a world where anarchy and crime is rampant, the Defence Authority is a refuge for those seeking peace from the harsh world.\n\nThe quest of Permanent Peace is much different than this however. It is an idea, an idea proposed by General Valer Serrano to end anarchy all together. A goal that is possible to be reached since the foundation of it in 2220. Which -of course- requires the small dedication of weekly food donation quotas for the citizenry to achieve.\n\nAnd it WILL be achieved! Just be patient!"
