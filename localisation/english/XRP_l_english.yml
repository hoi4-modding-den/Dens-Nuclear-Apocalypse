 XRP_history_desc:0 "In the Rhineland, amongst the old ruins, of steel frames and pockmarked hills, lies a specter of Germany's past. \n \nHaving only barely survived the Third World War, the American descendants of the soldiers and officers in America’s military bases, have continually maintained their independence against the Germans since the nuclear winter lifted. By 2200, the Americans had expanded their borders to include the whole of Rhineland-Palatinate, in the name of “national defense”. But with the German population oppressed and rebellious, and the army already stretched to its limit, America will either have to change its ways, or be relegated to the German history books."

 XRP_american_supremacism_long:0 "United States European Command"
 XRP_american_supremacism_desc:0 "American Supremacism is less a coherent, well-defined ideology, and more of the ‘logical conclusion’ to the concept of American Exceptionalism. Held by many Americans in Europe, American Supremacists view Americans as inherently better than other people, as Americans are inherently virtuous and loyal to the ideals of liberty, capitalism, and individualism. American Supremacists believe that the American way of life must be protected, by any means necessary, even at the cost of said liberties."
 XRP_american_republicanism:0 "Old Guard"
 XRP_american_republicanism_long:0 "Democratically Inclined Senior Officers"
 XRP_american_republicanism_desc:0 "American Republicanism is an ideology that seeks to establish a republic in the style of the old American government prior to the Third World War, believing that the American style of democracy was the reason for the United States being the most stable and powerful nation in history, and that it should be emulated to recapture its successes. American Republicanists aim to establish a strong presidency, an electoral college, a two party election system, and a neoliberal economic outlook."

 XRP_deutsch_apartheid_desc:0 "The Government of the Rhineland is primarily run by and for Americans, the descendants of the soldiers and officers who occupied the US military installations that peppered the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, prior to the Third World War. German 'civilians' are not granted the same protections, rights, or opportunities, as American 'citizens', and are generally seen as 'obstructive' at best by senior officers of the armed forces.\n§RIf the German influence on our government exceeds our own, we may face a revolt against us." 
 XRP_deutsch_apartheid_recruitment:0 "German Segregation"
 XRP_deutsch_apartheid_recruitment_desc:0 "The Government of the Rhineland is primarily run by and for Americans, the descendants of the soldiers and officers who occupied the US military installations that peppered the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, prior to the Third World War. The drafting of German civilians has arguably furthered the divide between Germans and Americans, with Germans being unhappy with being expected to die ''in an American's war''."
 XRP_american_ideals:0 "Lingering Liberal Ideals"
 XRP_american_ideals_desc:0 "America was always held up as a 'shining beacon of liberty and democracy', starkly in contrast to our current military government.

 XRP_radical_youth_desc:0 "Despite our propaganda efforts, the new generation of American soldiers seem to be increasingly disillusioned in both our military government and the ideals of democracy, seeing them as lies in the face of german oppression, and military service as a waste of their youth.

 XRP_Cavoli:0 "Gavin C. Cavoli"
 XRP_Cavoli_desc:0 "A distant descendant of Christopher G. Cavoli, who led EUCOM during the Third World War, Gavin C. Cavoli was trained from birth to eventually hold the office of 'Supreme Allied Commander', and has done so since 2230. Despite this, Cavoli has had a seeming lack of interest in military affairs, and has instead commanded more as a monarch than a true military leader, being more content to hold the spotlight and give speeches than actually command or even understand his role in the military. However, this arrangement is considered acceptable by high command due to him ‘rubber stamping’ any bills or commands given to him. Some in high command have had concerns that this arrangement could collapse if he ever takes a more firm stance on anything, but for now, everything is ‘smooth sailing’."
 XRP_Williams:0 "Marcus D. Williams"
 XRP_Williams_desc:0 "Descendant of General Darryl A. Williams, who led the U.S. Army Europe and Africa during the Third World War, Marcus D. Williams has taken over leadership of the country in the chaos of Cavoli’s assassination. Having graduated from Ramstine Military Academy in 2195, Williams served in the final conquests of the Rhineland, where he was established as a skilled commander in the Battle of Westerwaldkreis. Since then, he has entrenched himself in the army, having acted as one of the most democratically inclined generals, having pushed for more democratic reforms, but having been rejected on most efforts. With the democratic generals now in power, the American Rhineland can fully reform to a democratic republic, though some doubt how far Williams will actually take the reforms, or if elections will even occur."

You are in enemy country.'' \n As a new soldier, your job in Germany is to end the German cycle of war. You may think that some of them must be okay, but which ones? Until the day the German people have been cured of their desires for conquest, trust none of them. Just one mistake may cost you your life."
 XRP_ceremony:0 "The [GetYear] Academy Graduation Ceremony"
 XRP_ceremony_desc:0 "One of the most prestigious annual events in our country, the cadet graduation ceremony is one of the largest in post-war record, thanks to the growth of the local American population in recent years. Several high-ranking officials will be attending the festivities, with speeches from generals, honored cadets, and even the Commander himself, General of the Army Gavin C. Cavoli, is expected to make a speech."
 XRP_recruit_germans:0 "Expand German Recruitment"
 XRP_recruit_germans_desc:0 "Although we have a poor relationship with the Germans, it’s simply not viable in the long run to maintain a system that puts good, hard working Americans in the front lines. If we want to maintain our way of life, we need to expand the recruitment system and allow for the local population to take on a more ‘expendable’ role in the armed forces. Some of the higher-ups likely won’t be happy with this."
 XRP_recruit_americans:0 "Maintain an American Army"
 XRP_recruit_americans_desc:0 "Despite the fact that our American population is outnumbered fairly significantly by the local German population, the fact remains that the Germans cannot be trusted.

 XRP.NE_1.t:0 "The American Occupation Zone"
 XRP.NE_1.d:0 "Ever since the end of the Second World War in 1945, the United States armed forces has maintained one of the largest overseas military detachments in the world in Western Germany. All with one goal in mind — to guarantee American control over Germany, either against the Germans in the Second World War, or with the Germans in the Third World War. \n\n 'The State of Rhineland-Palatinate', as it was formerly known, was placed directly under the martial law of the 'United States European Command' following the outbreak of the Third World War. Only through a combination of the enemy's poor maintenance of their nuclear arsenal, experimental anti-nuclear satellites, and pure luck, that Ramstein Air Base avoided being reduced to just a memory of a mushroom cloud. The Americans who survived the cataclysm lied in wait in their bunkers, coming out from the dust around 2050 to a world reduced to tribalism. These stranded Americans rebuilt Ramstein Air Base into a true American-style city, and the large surplus of modern military equipment meant the Americans were always a step ahead of the nearby Germans, who had become nearly feudalistic in the aftermath of the war. Ramstein would become a full nation-state in its own right, asserting itself in the world in the face of attempted invasions from neighboring German city-states. These cities ultimately failed to assert control over Ramstein, and would in-turn be conquered themselves over the course of the 22nd century. With the full 'reconquest' of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate around 2200 fueling expansionist appetites within the Rhinish government, the American forces have been further radicalized by the recent rise of the anarchists and the techno-communists to the north. These 'commie bastards' only further solidified what the military high-command always knew, that the German people cannot be trusted to run themselves. However, with American forces already over-stretched from the occupation of the whole state, and the German population here becoming increasingly recalcitrant to American governance, it's clear that something has to change."

 XRP.NE_2.d:0 "A young cadet sat at his table, watching the kitchen staff as they ran in and out of the kitchen, getting meals out to the hundreds of other cadets in the commons room.\n\n‘‘Is there something on your mind, Matt?’’\n\n‘‘What?’’ asked Matthew, failing to feign ignorance of how he looked.\n\n‘‘Hey, I know how you are, somethings on your mind... Also, you haven’t even touched your cornbread yet.’’\n\n‘‘You can have it,’’ said Matt, as he returned to his observation.\n\nThe kitchen staff briefly conversed in German, something about a table, what little Matthew knew of German didn’t help with the distance. Quickly, the waiter rushed back into the kitchen...\n\n‘‘Is it the Germans?’’ asked the friend, ‘‘I wouldn’t worry about it,’’\n\n‘‘Wouldn’t worry about it? We practically use them as slaves,’’ said Matt frustratedly, ‘‘Didn’t we fight a war over this?’’\n\nThe waiter ran out of the kitchen, drink tray in hand. Just from the direction alone, Matt could tell he was heading to the officer’s table, just a few yards apart from the rest of the tables.\n\n‘‘Yeah, it’s bad, but what can you do?’’ said the friend.\n\nA crash sounds through the hall, and one of the sargents stands up, a wet stain adorning his suit. \n\n‘‘You Nazi bastard, do you have any idea how much this coat cost!’’ Shouted the sergeant, walking over to the waiter on the ground. ‘‘This is coming out of YOUR paycheck, ‘Deutscher’!’’, he shouted as he kicked the waiter in the gut. As he walked back to his seat, the silence of the room became obvious, and the other Cadets slowly went back to eating, as if nothing ever happened."

 XRP.NE_3.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of the American military government to maintain security, tensions have reached a breaking point. While few expected the German population to gracefully accept the increasingly harsh and expendable treatment that they have been put under, nobody quite realized just how volatile the situation really was. With support for the military government at an all-time low, in part due to the heavy-handed nature of many of our ‘‘reforms’’ having alienated some of our American support base. \n\nNonetheless, what started out as a simple dispute in the small city of Trier almost instantly escalated into a series of riots throughout the nation. The armed force’s typical response of brutal retaliation had the opposite effect from usual, only fanning the flames on a fire that was growing out of control. Mutinies in the army followed, as the low-ranking soldiers refused to fire on the German civilians. \n\nOver the course of about 48 hours, American authority completely collapsed in the Rhineland, as Ramstein and Spangdahlem bases struggled to maintain order in their own barracks. The message was clear: the oppression of Germans would no longer be tolerated. A German militia had formed outside Ramstein, determined to end the violent regime once and for all. American high-command, sensing the inevitable, quickly took whatever gold and cash they had, and boarded a flight to Switzerland, hoping that the Swiss would recognize pre-war American treaties instead of an ‘‘illegal revolt’’. As sympathetic cadets opened the gates, German forces overran the bases and tore up the command centers. After over a hundred years of American rule, The Rhineland is now German once again."

American military authority in the state has collapsed completely, and hastily-formed German militias have marched on Ramstein Air Base, seemingly let into the base by disillusioned American cadets. The American administration has seemingly fled the base by plane, to a more amenable state. The Germans now in charge of the Rhineland have restored the pre-war federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate, and have established a provisional government, intending to transition to a democratic republic."

The track gained an iconic status within motorsport circles, only furthered by the raceway having been made accessible to the public for Touristenfahrten, or Tourist Trips. In the aftermath of the Third World War, the trip around ‘‘The Green Hell’’ has gained an almost mecca-like status in German automotive circles, an experience that every car enthusiast must experience.
