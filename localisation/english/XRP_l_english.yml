 XRP_history_desc:0 "In the Rhineland, amongst the old ruins, of steel frames and pockmarked hills, lies a specter of Germany's past. \n \nHaving only barely survived the Third World War, the American descendants of the soldiers and officers in America’s military bases, have continually maintained their independence against the Germans since the nuclear winter lifted. By 2200, the Americans had expanded their borders to include the whole of Rhineland-Palatinate, in the name of “national defense”. But with the German population oppressed and rebellious, and the army already stretched to its limit, America will either have to change its ways, or be relegated to the German history books."

 XRP_american_supremacism_long:0 "United States European Command"
 XRP_american_supremacism_desc:0 "American Supremacism is less a coherent, well-defined ideology, and more of the ‘logical conclusion’ to the concept of American Exceptionalism. Held by many Americans in Europe, American Supremacists view Americans as inherently better than other people, as Americans are inherently virtuous and loyal to the ideals of liberty, capitalism, and individualism. American Supremacists believe that the American way of life must be protected, by any means necessary, even at the cost of said liberties."

 XRP_american_republicanism_long:0 "Democratically Inclined Senior Officers"
 XRP_american_republicanism_desc:0 "American Republicanism is an ideology that seeks to establish a republic in the style of the old American government prior to the Third World War, believing that the American style of democracy was the reason for the United States being the most stable and powerful nation in history, and that it should be emulated to recapture its successes. American Republicanists aim to establish a strong presidency, an electoral college, a two party election system, and a neoliberal economic outlook."

 XRP_deutsch_apartheid_desc:0 "The Government of the Rhineland is primarily run by and for Americans, the descendants of the soldiers and officers who occupied the US military installations that peppered the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, prior to the Third World War. German 'civilians' are not granted the same protections, rights, or opportunities, as American 'citizens', and are generally seen as 'obstructive' at best by senior officers of the armed forces.\n§RIf the German influence on our government exceeds our own, we may face a revolt against us." 
 XRP_deutsch_apartheid_recruitment:0 "German Segregation"
 XRP_deutsch_apartheid_recruitment_desc:0 "The Government of the Rhineland is primarily run by and for Americans, the descendants of the soldiers and officers who occupied the US military installations that peppered the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, prior to the Third World War. The drafting of German civilians has arguably furthered the divide between Germans and Americans, with Germans being unhappy with being expected to die ''in an American's war''."

 XRP_Cavoli:0 "Gavin C. Cavoli"
 XRP_Cavoli_desc:0 "A distant descendant of Christopher G. Cavoli, who led EUCOM during the Third World War, Gavin C. Cavoli was 'trained' from birth to eventually hold the office of 'Supreme Allied Commander', and has done so since 2230, following the death of the previous commander. Despite this, Cavoli has had a seeming lack of interest in military affairs, and has instead commanded more as a monarch than a true military leader, being more content to hold the spotlight and give speeches than actually command or even understand his role in the military. However, this arrangement is considered acceptable by high command due to him ‘rubber stamping’ any bills or commands given to him. Some in high command have had concerns that this arrangement could collapse if he ever takes a more firm stance on anything, but for now, everything is ‘smooth sailing’."
 XRP_Williams:0 "Marcus D. Williams"
 XRP_Williams_desc:0 "Descendant of General Darryl A. Williams, who led the U.S. Army Europe and Africa during the Third World War, Marcus D. Williams has taken over leadership of the country in the chaos of Cavoli’s assassination. Having graduated from Ramstine Military Academy in 2195, Williams served in the final conquests of the Rhineland, where he was established as a skilled commander in the Battle of Westerwaldkreis. Since then, he has entrenched himself in the army, having acted as one of the most democratically inclined generals, having pushed for more democratic reforms, but having been rejected on most efforts. With the democratic generals now in power, the American Rhineland can fully reform to a democratic republic, though some doubt how far Williams will actually take the reforms, or if elections will even occur."

You are in enemy country.'' \n As a new soldier, your job in Germany is to end the German cycle of war. You may think that some of them must be okay, but which ones? Until the day the German people have been cured of their desires for conquest, trust none of them. Just one mistake may cost you your life."
 XRP_ceremony:0 "The [GetYear] Academy Graduation Ceremony"
 XRP_ceremony_desc:0 "One of the most prestigious annual events in our country, the cadet graduation ceremony is one of the largest in post-war record, thanks to the growth of the local American population in recent years. Several high-ranking officials will be attending the festivities, with speeches from generals, honored cadets, and even the Commander himself, General of the Army Gavin C. Cavoli, is expected to make a speech."
 XRP_recruit_germans:0 "Expand German Recruitment"
 XRP_recruit_germans_desc:0 "Although we have a poor relationship with the Germans, it’s simply not viable in the long run to maintain a system that puts good, hard working Americans in the front lines. If we want to maintain our way of life, we need to expand the recruitment system and allow for the local population to take on a more ‘expendable’ role in the armed forces. Some of the higher-ups likely won’t be happy with this."
 XRP_recruit_americans:0 "Maintain an American Army"
 XRP_recruit_americans_desc:0 "Despite the fact that our American population is outnumbered fairly significantly by the local German population, the fact remains that the Germans cannot be trusted. They cannot come back into the civilized fold just by sticking out their hand and saying “sorry”. Sorry? Not sorry they caused the war; they’re only sorry they lost it. We won’t make that mistake again."

 XRP_false_4:0 "Bread and Circuses"
 XRP_false_4_desc:0 "The most effective way to ensure the loyalty of a population is to grant them benefits of some kind. While we lack access to the luxuries of the early 21st century, steps can be taken to ensure a more loyal population. After all, it's not like they can have it any worse."

 XRP_false_6:0 "Remind Americans of 'German History'"
 XRP_false_6_desc:0 "We must remind our fellow Americans: You are up against German history. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the German people have, time and time again, chosen war over peace.

 XRP_false_7_desc:0 "The long time spent under martial law has been a constant headache for the Americans who seek to uphold 'true American values'. While we have done this before, in Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, rarely were American citizens privy to the way our 'guided governance' has operated. We should alleviate their fears, and offer some token concessions; after all, democracy is just a few decades away."
 XRP_false_8:0 "Prepare For The Inevitable"
 XRP_false_8_desc:0 "There's no ignoring it, we will be at war with the north in the future. It's only a matter of time.

 XRP_reward_loyality:0 "Reward Loyality"
 XRP_reward_loyality_desc:0 "No nation is run alone. The keys of governance need to be secured, and if we have to lubricate the wheels a bit to do so, then so be it. Our officers need to understand that, while we can take away, we can also provide."
 XRP_expand_surveilance:0 "Expand the Surveillance State"
 XRP_expand_surveilance_desc:0 "Why stop at surveiling just our officers? We can create a similar ''Oversight Committee'' for the general population as well as our officers. Security demands sacrafices, and besides, who cares if we know where you live, and where you work, and who you have contacts with. You have nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide."
 XRP_centralized_command:0 "Centralize the Command Structure"
 XRP_centralized_command_desc:0 "While we typically discipline the cadets, some amount of discipline would be good for our officers as well. Ensuring our officers answer directly to us will go a great way towards making sure nothing out of the ordinary occurs."

 XRP_curfews:0 "Establish Curfews"
 XRP_curfews_desc:0 "The Cadets have shown their true colors. If allowed unabated, they very well could topple our regime. By more strictly enforcing the rules on curfews, we should be able to restrict any cadet organization against us."
 XRP_control_media:0 "Control the Flow of Information"
 XRP_control_media_desc:0 "Our cadets shouldn't even know what socialism is, let alone advocate for anything similar to it. If our cadets think this way, so too may the rest of our population. By having a more ''direct'' role in the production of news, we can hopefully put an end to this treachery."
 XRP_no_tolerance:0 "'No Tolerance' Policy for Cadets"

 XRP.NE_1.t:0 "The American Occupation Zone"
 XRP.NE_1.d:0 "Ever since the end of the Second World War in 1945, the United States armed forces has maintained one of the largest overseas military detachments in the world in Western Germany. All with one goal in mind — to guarantee American control over Germany, either against the Germans in the Second World War, or with the Germans in the Third World War. \n\n 'The State of Rhineland-Palatinate', as it was formerly known, was placed directly under the martial law of the 'United States European Command' following the outbreak of the Third World War. Only through a combination of the enemy's poor maintenance of their nuclear arsenal, experimental anti-nuclear satellites, and pure luck, that Ramstein Air Base avoided being reduced to just a memory of a mushroom cloud. The Americans who survived the cataclysm lied in wait in their bunkers, coming out from the dust around 2050 to a world reduced to tribalism. These stranded Americans rebuilt Ramstein Air Base into a true American-style city, and the large surplus of modern military equipment meant the Americans were always a step ahead of the nearby Germans, who had become nearly feudalistic in the aftermath of the war. Ramstein would become a full nation-state in its own right, asserting itself in the world in the face of attempted invasions from neighboring German city-states. These cities ultimately failed to assert control over Ramstein, and would in-turn be conquered themselves over the course of the 22nd century. With the full 'reconquest' of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate around 2200 fueling expansionist appetites within the Rhinish government, the American forces have been further radicalized by the recent rise of the anarchists and the techno-communists to the north. These 'commie bastards' only further solidified what the military high-command always knew, that the German people cannot be trusted to run themselves. However, with American forces already over-stretched from the occupation of the whole state, and the German population here becoming increasingly recalcitrant to American governance, it's clear that something has to change."

Also, you haven’t even touched your cornbread yet.’’\n\n‘‘You can have it,’’ said Matt, as he returned to his observation.\n\nThe kitchen staff briefly conversed in German, something about a table, what little Matthew knew of German didn’t help with the distance. Quickly, the waiter rushed back into the kitchen...\n\n‘‘Is it the Germans?’’ asked the friend, ‘‘I wouldn’t worry about it,’’\n\n‘‘Wouldn’t worry about it? We practically use them as slaves,’’ said Matt frustratedly, ‘‘Didn’t we fight a war over this?’’\n\nThe waiter ran out of the kitchen, drink tray in hand. Just from the direction alone, Matt could tell he was heading to the officer’s table, just a few yards apart from the rest of the tables.\n\n‘‘Yeah, it’s bad, but what can you do?’’ said the friend.\n\nA crash sounds through the hall, and one of the sargents stands up, a wet stain adorning his suit. \n\n‘‘You Nazi bastard, do you have any idea how much this coat cost!’’ Shouted the sergeant, walking over to the waiter on the ground. ‘‘This is coming out of YOUR paycheck, ‘Deutscher’!’’, he shouted as he kicked the waiter in the gut.

 XRP.NE_3.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of the American military government to maintain security, tensions have reached a breaking point. While few expected the German population to gracefully accept the increasingly harsh and expendable treatment that they have been put under, nobody quite realized just how volatile the situation really was. With support for the military government at an all-time low, in part due to the heavy-handed nature of many of our ‘‘reforms’’ having alienated some of our American support base. \n\nNonetheless, what started out as a simple dispute in the small city of Trier almost instantly escalated into a series of riots throughout the nation. The armed force’s typical response of brutal retaliation had the opposite effect from usual, only fanning the flames on a fire that was growing out of control. Mutinies in the army followed, as the low-ranking soldiers refused to fire on the German civilians. \n\nOver the course of about 48 hours, American authority completely collapsed in the Rhineland, as Ramstein and Spangdahlem bases struggled to maintain order in their own barracks. The message was clear: the oppression of Germans would no longer be tolerated. A German militia had formed outside Ramstein, determined to end the violent regime once and for all. American high-command, sensing the inevitable, quickly took whatever gold and cash they had, and boarded a flight to Switzerland, hoping that the Swiss would recognize pre-war American treaties instead of an ‘‘illegal revolt’’. As sympathetic cadets opened the gates, German forces overran the bases and tore up the command centers. After over a hundred years of American rule, The Rhineland is now German once again."

Mutinies in the army followed, as the low-ranking soldiers refused to fire on the German civilians. \n\nOver the course of about 48 hours, American authority completely collapsed in the Rhineland, as Ramstein and Spangdahlem bases struggled to maintain order in their own barracks. The message was clear: the oppression of Germans would no longer be tolerated. A German militia had formed outside Ramstein, determined to end the violent regime once and for all. American high-command, sensing the inevitable, quickly took whatever gold and cash they had and, in a repeat of the Nazis in the Second World War, boarded a flight to Spain, seeking refuge in the fascist Pyrenees State. As sympathetic cadets opened the gates, German forces overran the bases and tore up the command centers. After over a hundred years of American rule, The Rhineland is now German once again."

The status of the Germans will not change. He had heard this half a dozen times before, but there’s always someone else in charge, all he had to do was navigate the minefield that was ‘professionally negotiating with his superiors’.\n\n‘‘Sir, if I may, considering the urgency of the situation, would it be possible for you to direct me to whomst is in control of these affairs?‘‘\n\nUnexpectedly for Matthew, the General seemed to lean forward in his chair, rubbing the bridge between his eyes, ‘‘Look, Davis was it, I don’t know how to tell you this in the most polite terms, so I’m just going to tell you. I appreciate your ‘nobility’, but you’re not going to get anywhere with this. High command is set on ‘maintaining order at any cost’, and even if you get all the way up to Cavoli, the circumstances are just not there.

Was he really okay with the status quo? ‘‘Sir, do you think the situation will change anytime soon?’’\n\n‘‘Maybe if you climb the ranks, you can change how things are done.

The track gained an iconic status within motorsport circles, only furthered by the raceway having been made accessible to the public for Touristenfahrten, or Tourist Trips. In the aftermath of the Third World War, the trip around ‘‘The Green Hell’’ has gained an almost mecca-like status in German automotive circles, an experience that every car enthusiast must experience.

I would like to start with...’’\n\nJust off stage, Matthew Davis was waiting for his moment. Having figured out which cadet was being asked to give the first speech after Cavoli, he just had to wait for him to show up. Matthew struggled to contain his nerves. He rationalized his upcoming actions as ‘necessary’, that he would have done this with the nazis 300 years ago, that the system of economic oppression can only be taken down with violence, that if anyone could do it, it would be him. After all, he is an American, they won’t kill him. Right on time, the honored cadet of the ceremony walked into the backstage.\n\n‘‘Hey man, there’s been a scheduling conflict, apparently you’ve been moved back a few speeches’’\n\n‘‘You’ve gotta be joking.’’\n\n‘‘Hey, don’t take it out on the messenger, alright?’’\n\nThat seemed to work, as the ‘honored cadet’ went to go look for the manager, a tall order considering how many people seemed to shuffle in and out of the backstage. Behind the trunks of instruments and sound equipment lie a makeshift shotgun, made out of tape and plastic plumbing. Matthew put on a large coat from the costumes nearby, hoping its size will be enough to hide the gun. Was it time yet?\n\n‘‘...believe me, schooling was not easy for me. I couldn’t care less about gun maintenance or...’’ another one of Cavoli’s overly long speeches. That man never passes up an opportunity to hog the spotlight. Perhaps Matthew would be doing everyone a favor if he went out early. Matthew gave a slight chuckle to himself. God, am I really doing this? He double checked the weapon’s trigger, concerned if his wiring would work. He thought it over, like he had for weeks prior, slavery was wrong, segregation was wrong, murder was wrong. Right? Someone has to put an end to this, even if it meant-\n\n‘‘...and now, without further ado, please welcome to the stage...’’\n\nShowtime. As calmly as he could muster, Matthew stuffed the weapon into the coat, and walked up to the stage. The audience clapped, unaware. Cavoli seemed oblivious to the switcheroo, as if he didn’t even bother to check who was supposed to come out. As Matthew closed the gap, all he had to do was just act natural..."

It had been several months since the assassination of Cavoli. Everyone wondered what had happened to our old friend Matt. It was a question that lingered in the back of John’s mind. It lingered in everyone’s mind. John thought what Matthew did was horrible, but he respected his beliefs. If he could go out on stage and shoot the commander over the lives of others, perhaps there was something in there worth believing. People don’t just throw away their lives for nothing. Was it wrong to make the Germans work for us? Were we the bad guys?\n\nA sergeant and a general he did not recognize walked up to the range, dragging with them a cadet, with a bag over his head and restraints around his legs. Once they had reached the range, they moved the cadet to the middle of the range, and stood him still. The general wiped off his glasses, and spoke to the crowd of about a hundred privates.\n\n‘‘The cadet you see before you, Matthew H. Davis, has been found guilty. The crimes, treason, murder, terrorism, antisemitism, and communist sympathies. The penalty is death.’’ An air of silence filled the range. Not even a bird made a sound. ‘‘Let this be a reminder to all of you, of the dangers of anti-American thinking.’’\n\nThis sort of thing would have never happened before this, John thought. Aren’t we Americans? Aren’t we better than this? What ever happened to the right to a fair trial? What ever happened to democracy? How did we get to this point? Maybe America was always this way, just in private. It’s not like anyone remembers history from before the great war. Maybe there was never a democracy at all?\n\n‘‘You may fire when ready.’’"

He had sat in the back of the truck for hours, waiting it out. This had to be it, right? They were gonna do a show trial and do... something. Right? There’s gonna be a big dramatic show of ‘‘Order’’ and ‘‘Obeying the law’’ and they’re gonna make a big deal over what it means to be an American or something. This is how things were, at least, under Cavoli. But if it was that, they wouldn’t have driven him out for what must be a hundred kilometers, if not more. They wouldn’t kill him, right? Americans were always excluded from the death penalty. Was this the day the state made no exceptions? The truck suddenly came to a halt. The doors opened, and Matthew was brought out onto the gravel, and the bag that covered his head was removed.\n\n‘‘Okay kid, this is the outskirts of Bonn. Get out.’’\n‘‘What?’’ said Matthew, ‘‘What do you mean ‘get out’?’’\n‘‘I mean, leave. Your citizenship has been revoked, you are no longer an American. This is the Laagish border. Are we clear?’’\n‘‘You’re just gonna throw me out? No trial? No show? Nothing?’’\n‘‘Nothing. I would say the council was lenient, but trust me, this is easier for all of us.’’\n\nHe could hardly believe it. This is how it ends? Just a quick drive and a ‘go away’? That’s it?\nAlmost to underscore the point, just moments after the officer finished speaking, he simply turned around and got back in the truck. Without even looking back, the truck turned around on the gravel road, and drove off back to Ramstein. All Matthew could do in that moment was just stand there, and watch."
