 XNE_news.1.desc: "After much discussion between the governments of [XNE.GetNameDef] and [XNM.GetNameDef], it seems a conclusion has now been reached. In a monumental speech from Leicester today, [XNE.GetLeader] has announced that his government now officially recognises [XNM.GetNameDef] as a sovereign state, ending years of conflict since the Nuclear War and entering both countries into a new age. Only the future knows what this means long-term for the stability of the British Isles."
 XNE_news.1.a: "A historic event!"
 XNE_news.2.title: "A Meeting in Birmingham"
 XNE_news.2.desc: "Today in a hall in Birmingham $XNE_anti_revisionism_party_long$ met to discuss the state of the country and its workforce. One young man, $XNE_oswald_joyce$, proved to be popular in particular, and has been quickly rising up the ranks of the party. The Left have a lot of popularity among the people, with the post-Nuclear depression affecting many of the lower-class harshly, so an organised movement could prove to be a threat to [XNE.GetLeader]'s government."
 XNE_news.2.a: "Perhaps they have a point"
 XNE_news.3.title: "The Death of Gerald 'Fred' Fredricksen"
 XNE_news.3.desc: "It has been announced that Gerald 'Fred' Fredricksen peacefully died in his sleep in the early hours of the morning, at the age of 78. Fred was the first Prime Minister after the Nuclear War and it is said he was the Uncle of Democracy, bringing it back to New New England after so long. How much his government actually achieved is still up to debate, but he did restore suffrage to those in the larger cities."
 XNE_news.3.a: "Is democracy dead?"
 XNE_news.4.title: "The State of England - by Jesse Smith"
 XNE_news.4.desc: "...There is every kind of corruption that their money power can afford, and they will go to any length to forbid us halls in which to speak. And then, when they forbid us halls in which to speak, their papers are able to turn round and say: 'Of course, they don’t exist. You don’t see them speaking in big halls, you don't read about them in the newspapers, and, therefore, it's all imagination that this revolution of the British people is taking place at all.' In fact, my friends, we are faced by a coalition of the money power in Press and in Parliament and in the ownership of the great halls of England, who are so mortally afraid of the English people being permitted to hear the truth that to any length they will proceed to forbid even me speaking to them..."
 XNE_news.4.a: "Jesse Smith is more popular by the day"
 XNE_news.5.title: "Bill N-4C Passes"
 XNE_news.5.desc: "While a faily insignificant bill in itself, removing the tax on a few home essentials like cakes, bill N-4C is the first bill since the Reformation to have been proposed by a member of $XNE_liberal_long$ and pass. It marks an end to the complete political domination of the Conservatives and opens the door for $XNE_liberal_long$, even if only slightly."
 XNE_news.5.a: "Government works!"
 XNE_news.6.title: "Fascist Riots in Plymouth"
 XNE_news.6.desc: "After tensions have been rising in the last few months in Plymouth due to some mistakes by the local government, it's no surprise the city has been experiencing a full-scale riot for the last 4 days. Many supporters of $XNE_jesse_smith$ and his articles have took to the streets and shops, both local and national, have been looted. A lot of these so-called patriots have since been arrested, but [Root.GetLeader] has been criticised that the ring-leaders of the riots have escaped custody. Only time will tell if this is to become a common occurence."
 XNE_news.6.a: "This is concerning..."
 XNE_news.7.title: "Communist Riots in London"
 XNE_news.7.desc: "People have taken to the streets in London! Less than a month after the riots in Plymouth, a series Communist-organised riots have taken place across London, specifically targeting government-run buildings. It is becoming clearer by the day that [XNE.GetLeader]'s government is not doing enough in this new world."
 XNE_news.7.a: "Democracy is failing us"
 XNE_news.8.title: "The English Housing Crisis"
 XNE_news.8.desc: "It can be ignored no longer. After the Nuclear War many homes were destroyed in some of the largest cities in England, leading to a nationwide housing shortage. Intervention has been requested by the government and it seems that [XNE.GetLeader] is finally starting to listen. Only time will tell if they left it too late."

 XNE_news.9.title: "A Vault in Colchester"
 XNE_news.9.desc: "After expanding mining investments on the outskirts of Colchester, New New English miners have come across a vault which has seemingly been undisturbed since before the Nuclear War. Initial findings have revealed while there seems to have been significant flooding, some books and textbooks have survived from the 20th and 21st Century. If they can decipher what these say, they may be able to reclaim technology lost to the fallout."
