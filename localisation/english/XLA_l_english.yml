 ## Events
 XLA_event.1.t:0 "The Roots of Arnmouth"
 XLA_event.1.d:0 "In the year of our lord 2024 CE, the bombs fell. Almost all life was irradicated across the Italian peninsula. Centuries of history were wiped out in an instant. What was left was but a crude shell of a former empire and nation. As the radiation from the nuclear fallout began to clear, those who had managed to survive and their offspring emerged onto the tattered land, forming tribes. The people of Italy had begun to re-establish their own localized civilizations around the year of our lord 2100 CE. Through the hundreds of tribes, infighting began. Brother conquered brother, and eventually the tribes with the strongest might economically, militarily, and academically emerged superior. \n\nAround the year 2145 CE, one man had a dream. He emerged from a small sanctuary city called Auctermunty with a dream. He would conquer the remaining tribes, and bring about unity to what was once known as Italy. This man would eventually become the founder of the Lost Tribes of Arnmouth. Through his expertise in working with local leaders, as well as the might of a small band of mercenaries that became known as the Antrorus Graticas, the tribes which had once been hundreds of independent clans had united into 8 regions, with one special region surrounding his home town, now the capital of the chiefdom dubbed The Lost Tribes of Arnmouth. \n\nThough this man of legend did not live long enough to see the emergence of the factions, his belief established a new power that could hold off encroaching the barbaric regions of the peninsula as well as what had once been France. This did not stop superstition from rising unfortunately. While trying to claim the sea for the Lost Tribes, disaster continuously struck. Every brave sailor who dared to venture beyond sight of the coast would return a corpse or a broken shell of a man. The gods of the sea clearly had no good will towards the Arnmouthen. \n\nWith the stabilization of society under The Elder’s Council, two major factions began to emerge. Within the tribes that had once been renowned for their intellectual prowess, the Altwigite Order emerged. Under the guidance of the order, based in the coastal city of Nubbikport, the resurgence of pre-nuclear technology began. A faction that’s sole goal is the return of society to before the bombs, and to advance beyond that to a future where even space is within our reaches, they are directly opposed to the Spiritual Alliance. While the Altwigitians develop weapons of war, the Spiritualists are those who reconnect with nature and the gods. The Spiritualists are opposed to war, and believe in harmony for everyone, while willing to fight if the gods compel it. The Spiritualists desire a return to a society where man did not rule over man, but instead worked as equals. Between these two diametrically opposed factions, the Neutrals insist on balance within the Elder’s Council. Now led by chairman Elder Borani, the Neutrals have held power for most of the existence of Arnmouth, although their rule is fickle."
 XLA_event.1.a:0 "Fascinating."
 XLA_event.2.t:0 "The Elders Council"
 XLA_event.2.d:0 "Within the halls of government, a rumor whips between the loose lips of the Elders. The nation may be headed to war. The people have begun hiding away in their homes within the major cities, and the villages have become standoffish with any outsider being turned away at their gates. Elder Borani has called the Elders Council for an emergency meeting discussing this rumor. Within this fateful meeting, one elder has stepped forward. Elder Sistenos, the frail man from the neutral region of Ferndochty has decided to state directly to the council the rumor. As soon as he begins speaking, Elders from each of the factions begin shouting over him, refusing to let him speak. Chaos erupts immediately, papers and drinks go flying in the air as each of the elders get increasingly ferocious at each other. Elder Borani, his health increasingly getting weaker with age, finally steps up and calls for order, allowing Sistenos to speak. He clears his throat and begins to speak in his soft voice, \"Ladies and Gentlemen of the Council of Arnmouth, I bring to you today whispers of war. Despite the strong foundations our forefathers have established for us, we threaten to have it collapse in an instant. Factionalism has brough about ruin to this great nation, and I will not stand for it! In these troubling times, we must stand together as one united nation!\" As soon as the last word leaves his mouth, he collapses to the floor. Security personnel rush to help him, but the floor erupts into chaos once again. The nation, once fighting strongly against the Barbaric nations on our borders as one, now threatens to collapse into infighting again."

 XLA_event.3.t:0 "The Fate of Elder Borani"
 XLA_event.3.d:0 "A few days after the collapse of Elder Sistenos during the previous council meeting, Elder Borani has fallen ill once again. His lifelong battle with various diseases has left him scarred and frail, and his health now in shatters. Elder Borani, who has long been a steadfast figure in the council, is now facing one of his greatest personal challenges yet. His resilience has always been a beacon for the Neutrals, but this latest illness has shaken the confidence of many. \n\nWith the collapse of society in the year of our lord 2024 CE, much of the advanced medical technology from the pre-nuclear era has been lost. This regression has left Arnmouth struggling to treat even the most common ailments effectively. Elder Borani's condition, exacerbated by the lack of adequate medical resources, has become a stark reminder of the ongoing struggle to reclaim the knowledge and capabilities of the past. Rushed to the state hospital in Auctermunty after falling ill in his home, Borani's chances of recovery appear bleak. \n\nAs Borani lies in the care of the state hospital, the political atmosphere in Arnmouth grows increasingly tense. The Neutrals, already reeling from the collapse of Elder Sistenos, are now grappling with the potential loss of another key leader. The Altwigitians and Spiritualists watch closely, aware that Borani's fate could significantly alter the balance of power within the council. Amidst the uncertainty, calls for unity and renewed efforts to recover lost medical technologies grow louder, as the nation collectively hopes for a miracle that might save Elder Borani."

 XLA_event.4.t.a:0 "The Death of Elder Borani"
 XLA_event.4.d:0 "Despite his near terminal odds of survival, Elder Borani has made a miraculous recovery! While his health is still in uncertain condition, he will remain in the care of medical experts from across Arnmouth, but he is sure to return to government within a few weeks. \n\nElder Borani's recovery, while greeted with relief by those who support the Councilittes, has elicited a more reserved response from the major factions. The medical team overseeing his care is composed of top specialists from across Arnmouth, comprised of doctors of all three fields of the political spectrum. Dr. Alric, a renowned doctor from Pludenn, has been cautiously optimistic about Borani's progress, acknowledging the elder's resilience. \n\nIn the meantime, the political atmosphere remains tense. The Neutrals view Borani’s return as essential for stability within the Elders Council, while those who desire more power maintain a watchful distance. Elder Sistenos of Ferndochty has been one of the few openly expressing hope for Borani’s swift return, seeing his leadership as crucial in these uncertain times."
 XLA_event.14.d:0 "Despite the valiant efforts of medical experts from across Arnmouth, Elder Borani succumbed to his illness and passed away. His death marks the end of an era for the Lost Tribes, leaving the Elders Council further in turmoil during an already tumultuous time. \n\nA state funeral was held to honor Elder Borani's years of service to the Lost Tribes. The somber ceremony drew dignitaries and citizens alike, paying their respects to a leader who had long stood as a pillar of neutrality and stability. While the Neutrals mourned deeply, viewing his death as a significant loss, reactions from the Altwigitians and Spiritualists were more reserved. Their leaders acknowledged Borani’s contributions but remained focused on the power vacuum his passing has created. \n\nIn the wake of Elder Borani's death, the Elders Council faces a critical juncture. With the chairperson's seat now vacant, the need for a new representative has intensified factional tensions. Elder Sistenos of Ferndochty has called for an urgent meeting to address the leadership crisis, but the path forward remains fraught with uncertainty. As Arnmouth navigates this tumultuous period, the legacy of Elder Borani hangs heavily over the nation's future."

 XLA_event.5.t:0 "The Calm Or The Storm"
 XLA_event.5.d:0 "Late at night, in a quiet chamber within the Elders Council, Elder Borani, having recently recovered from his illness, meets privately with Elders Sistenos and Henndach. The nation stands at a crossroads, and the trio convenes to discuss the upcoming agenda known covertly as the calm or the storm within the halls of government \n\nElder Sistenos, the frail yet wise elder from Ferndochty, voices his concerns first. \"Borani, the scars of our recent conflicts are still fresh. Our people are weary, and our resources are stretched thin. By avoiding war at all costs, we can consolidate our support among the Neutrals and ensure that our nation remains stable. The unity and peace we can achieve now will be invaluable in the long run.\" \n\nElder Henndach, a more robust figure known for his strategic acumen, counters with a different perspective. \"While peace is desirable, we cannot ignore the threats that loom beyond our borders. Promoting enlisting will not only strengthen our defenses but also rally the people's spirit and give us the war support we need. It's a gamble, but one that could secure our nation's future against external threats.\" Elder Borani listens intently, weighing the gravity of their options. The decision will not be easy, but it will shape the fate of Arnmouth in these uncertain times."
 XLA_event.5.a:0 "Keep Calm. Carry On."
 XLA_event.5.b:0 "The Storm Rages On"
 XLA_event.6.t:0 "The Last Council Meeting?"
 XLA_event.6.d:0 "Elder Borani stood before the assembled Elders Council, his presence commanding the attention of all in attendance. The room was charged with anticipation. His recent recovery had invigorated the Neutrals, and now was the moment to consolidate their hard-won stability and unity. \n\n \"Fellow Elders,\" Borani began, his voice steady and resonant, \"we have weathered storms that threatened to tear us apart. Each of us here represents a different facet of our beloved Arnmouth, yet today, we stand united not by our differences, but by our common cause. Our people look to us not as fragmented factions, but as a council capable of guiding this nation through its most perilous times.\" \n\nHe paused, letting his words sink in before continuing. \"The time has come to put aside old grievances and work towards a future where our unity is our strength. We have protected our capital, the heart of Arnmouth, and in doing so, we have shown that when we act as one, we are unstoppable. Let us now turn our efforts inward, to heal the rifts that have divided us and to forge a council that stands as a beacon of hope and resilience.\" \n\nBorani’s gaze swept across the room, meeting the eyes of each elder. \"In our hands lies the power to shape the destiny of our great nation. Let us pledge today, before one another, to uphold the principles of unity and peace. Let us be the leaders our people believe us to be. Together, we will not only survive; we will thrive and build a future worthy of our past and our potential.\""
 XLA_event.6.a:0 "We Will Survive!"
 XLA_event.7.t:0 "A Proper Home"
 XLA_event.7.d:0 "As the Spiritual Alliance gathers within their grottos, protected by the ancient trees that survived since the great founder, they have come to decide on the capital of their alliance, Sinya Roma and Arangorn emerge as compelling candidates, each with its distinct challenges and allure. Sinya Roma, nestled in the south among the majestic mountains, holds a deep spiritual significance. Its rugged terrain offers natural defenses and a connection to the land that resonates deeply with the druidic beliefs of the Spiritualists. However, it is distant from the heart of the alliance. \n\nOn the other hand, Arangorn, positioned centrally between the capital of Arnmouth, Nubbikport of the Altwigitian Order, and coastal cities along the Adriatic, offers strategic advantages in terms of connectivity and trade. It’s central location provides ease of access to the Spiritualist beliefs, access to the other regions of the Lost Tribes, but at the cost of security.  \n\nThe deliberations within the Spiritual Alliance are fraught with considerations of practicality versus spirituality. Ultimately, the choice of capital will not only shape the physical landscape of their alliance, but also define its cultural and ideological foundations for generations to come."

 XLA_event.8.d:0 "In a dreary day, one man stands alone atop the hillside. His sword drawn, caked in blood and sweat. He gazes out, his loyal supporters standing beside him, but the enemies drawing closer than ever before. The war is nearing its conclusion, and only those with the true passion to fight will survive. War is brutal, war is bloody. War causes pain and suffering, the likes of which cannot be known to a land of peace. \n\nElder Borani calls out to the crowd standing before him to reject this bloody war. Stand against factionalism, stand for a united Arnmouth. The crowd, knowing only peace in our time, erupts into cheers before the weathered old man. The tribes will last another day, and may peace continue to last for yet another day."
 XLA_event.9.d:0 "Standing tall and resolute within the grand assembly hall of the mage tower in Kammora, Socellia Luzi, the predominant acolyte of the Altwigitian Order, delivered a fiery proclamation to a gathering of military commanders and supporters. Her voice, infused with righteous indignation, echoed off the vaulted ceilings as she declared, \"The time for neutrality has passed! The rise of our rivals within the Elders Council is a direct affront to the balance upheld for a century. Their pacifism, their aversion to progress stand in direct opposition to what we hold dear. They dare push us out of the Lost Tribes! We, the Altwigitian Order, cannot stand idly by while Arnmouth descends into chaos!\" \n\nWith conviction blazing in her eyes, Socellia continued, her words ringing with urgency and resolve. \"We demand that the Elders Council restore balance immediately or face the consequences. If they refuse, we will take it upon ourselves to restore unity to the Italian peninsula once and for all. Unlike our opponents, who preach harmony without strength, we stand ready to wield the might of our order to ensure the prosperity and security of our people.\" \n\nThe room stirred with a mix of anticipation and tension as Socellia's impassioned speech resonated among the gathered ranks. Her call to arms was met with nods of agreement and murmurs of approval from those who shared her vision of a unified and powerful Arnmouth under the banner of the Altwigitian Order. As she concluded, the air crackled with the weight of her declaration, signaling a pivotal moment in the history of their nation and the inevitable clash that loomed on the horizon."
 XLA_event.10.d:0 "Standing amidst the ancient grottos of the Spiritual Alliance's heartland, Samio, a druid known for his deep connection to nature, addressed a gathering of fervent supporters and fellow Spiritualists. His voice, resonant with both sorrow and determination, carried across the serene landscape as he denounced the recent actions of the Altwigitians within the Elders Council. \"The time for peace has been shattered by the aggressions of the Altwigitian Order,\" Samio proclaimed, his words imbued with a solemn urgency. \"Their blatant attacks against our beliefs and the rise of their militant agenda threaten to tip the delicate balance of our nation.\" \n\nWith eyes that mirrored the ancient wisdom of the forests around him, Samio continued, his voice gaining strength with each word. \"We, the Spiritualists, cannot allow such violations of neutrality to go unanswered. We demand that the Elders Council restore balance immediately and cease their assaults on our way of life. Our path is one of harmony and respect for all living beings, not one of conquest and domination.\" \n\nThe gathered crowd murmured in agreement, their faces reflecting a mix of resolve and concern for the future. Samio's call to defend their beliefs and way of life resonated deeply among the spiritualists, who had long sought to protect their traditions from the encroachment of militaristic ideologies. As he concluded his impassioned speech, the rustling leaves and the gentle breeze seemed to echo his call for unity and justice, setting the stage for a conflict that would test the very foundations of Arnmouth's identity."

The factions, having weathered significant tensions, now turned their focus towards restoring stability and charting a path forward for the nation. In response to calls for unity and effective governance, as well as the aging of Elder Borani, the Elders Council initiated the process of electing a new chairperson. This pivotal role would be instrumental in guiding Arnmouth through the complexities of rebuilding and ensuring a harmonious future. \n\n \"The time has come to restore faith in our council,\" declared one elder, their voice echoing the sentiments of many. \"We must select someone who is capable of guiding us through these uncertain times. Many threats assail us, and we need to stand united together!" \n\n Amidst discussions and deliberations across the regions of Arnmouth, candidates from each faction emerged, each presenting their vision for a renewed and cohesive nation. \"We need a leader who can bridge the divides that have threatened to tear us apart,\" emphasized another elder, emphasizing the need for reconciliation and forward-thinking leadership. As the election process unfolded, the eyes of the nation turned towards the Elders Council, hopeful for a new chapter marked by cooperation and mutual respect among the factions."
