 XCA.1.d:0 "The New Year's Convention, the first of the biannual meetings of the §3Grand Concorde of Sicily§!, has concluded, without the presence of our king. The §3Concorde§! has met every year since 2183, when it was first established. It consists of the ruler or ruling party of all participants, along with an impartial council consiting of 11 non-native Sicilians. This year, the council moved to proceed with the hearing even though King Marino III was absent. The king has been locked in his palace's concert hall for 3 weeks now, and the only people who have seen him in this time are his personal troupe, who say his obsession with music has finally reached a critical point."
