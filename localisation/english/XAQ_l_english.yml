 XAQ_esoteric_caesarism_desc:0 "Esoteric-Caesarism is an authoritarian system of governance that emphasizes strong centralized leadership combined with a deep, hidden understanding of the knowledge of the gods. Nations adopting this ideology are led by a charismatic leader who is believed to possess profound metaphysical insights and uses these to guide the nation toward greatness."
 XAQ_history_desc:0 "Years after the destruction of France during the Great Calamity, the Republic of Aquitaine stood battered by the storm, but united nonetheless. However that all changed when an obese neo-roman lunatic got his hands on an ancient nuke. Now, the Divine Realm of Gaul lies in his hands, whether his people adore or despise him."

#focus descriptions
 XAQ_secure_our_land_desc:0 "In these tumultuous times, we must ensure that we stay strong, lest we are consumed by our neighbours."
 XAQ_land_recolonisation_desc:0 "During the Great Calamity, the nuclear bombs dropped by our ancestors leveled the cities of Gaul, rendering its lands uninhabitable. Now, thanks to hundreds of years, the lands are now safe to set foot on again."
 XAQ_another_hundred_desc:0 "Like our predecessors, we will continue our rule in Europe for centuries to come. With the 100th anniversary of our regime, its time to jump towards a century of prosperity thrice as prosperous of that of the previous one."
 XAQ_movere_admirari_desc:0 "The ancients had amazing technology besides the nuclear bombs, including the illustrous "train". There exist trains in bunkers and storages which we can use to supply our troops for the reconquest of Gaul."
 XAQ_repeating_mistakes_desc:0 "If we could get ahold of the weaponry the ancients used to annihalate each other, we could easily dominate europe. Charles Sapiens, an expert on the Great Calamity and life before it, can help us acquire this technology."
 XAQ_long_march_home_desc:0 "Following the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD nearly 2 millenium ago, the world has degenerated into a flux of false and misintentioned governments. Rome is the birthplace of our great civilisation, to be without it is to be an eagle without its wings, a legion without its standard, in order to truly be worthy of our birthright, we must have it rendered unto Caesar"
 XAQ_griffin_desc:0 "Our Caesar has led us bravely though these turbulent times, he of all men is deserving to cross the rubicon and receive a Triumph in the streets of rome. We must ensure that we enable him to execute absolute power as was intended by Mars himself. Ave!"
 XAQ_spqr_desc:0 "In Ancient Rome, the senate was an advisory council and constituting assembly of the Roman Republic. It has been and is of great importance in enacting fair bureaucracy and laws. It is foolish to reject Petiot's rule but we must also empower the Senate to ensure prosperity."
 XAQ_rightfully_ours_desc:0 "Our Historicus have slaved away, piecing together maps of our grand domain at its peak, and it’s beautiful, stretching all across the known world, to not strive for its rebirth is to defy the gods, for it is clearly of divine inspiration. Ave Mars, guide our legions!"
 XAQ_cure_rome_desc:0 "What are we thinking, that Griffin is a raving mad man, his policies will kill us all, no god, not even the war hungry Mars would choose a beast like this, we cannot let him continue,  we must cure Romeo of his putride infection, before it's too late..."

 XAQ_senate_1_desc:0 "The last remnants of the old Aquitaine Republic, the senate stands now as a mostly ceremonial piece of Roman unity."
 XAQ_senate_2_desc:0 "The Senate now holds more power than before, but government function mostly remains in the griffin's hands."

 XAQ_annos_interitus_desc:0 "At the turn of the 23rd century, the Divine Realm of Lesser Gaul was shattered by its short-sighted attempt to realise its conquest of Gaul. Now, with its territories in Gallia Lugdunensis stripped, Lesser Gaul isn't what it used to be."
