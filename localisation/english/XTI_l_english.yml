 XTI_reclamation_council_desc:0 "After the bombs were dropped, nuclear winter took over the surface. To survive these horrid conditions, many fled to the bunkers. Some of these people hid deep in the Alps and formed their own societies. After a couple of generations, the first settlers emerged from their hideouts. The goal is to reclaim tirol for the Austrians. However, the council in charge of the vault has unknown loyalties. Only time will tell which direction they will lead this new society."
 XTI_elisa_desc:0 "The Anzengruber family has deepened their grip into the arisocratic class of Tirol. Starting in the 21st century, their political influence on society has grown evermore. Now that the chance has presented itself, the most prominant member of the Anzengruber family has taken the helm. She is known for her tight grip on politics and preference for loyalty above all else."
 XTI_leo_desc:0 "Leo Schmidt was a former vault leader who led his people with a steady hand. When the people began emerging back to the surface, he had gained fame through his model community. Now that democracy has been restored, he is the ideal leader to steady the ship in a sea of hostility."
 XTI_clara_desc:0 "Clara Bauer is a progressive advocate which is rare in the postwar world. During the vault days, she was a teacher and community organizer. Now she is a prominant voice for those who wouldn't have otherwise."
 XTI_louis_desc:0 "Louis Boltzmann represents the weariness of the people of Tirol. Many did not approve of vault leadership and looked for a man to rally behind. Boltzmann was this man. He had spent most of his time critisizing the degredation of society and freedom under council leadership. Although seemingly for the people, his motives are unclear and is notorious for flipping on important issues."

 ### EVENTS ###
 
 XTI.1.t:0 "Silence From Vienna"
 XTI.1.d:0 "'Hello? Hello! This is the head of the vaults of Tirol. Vienna command, are you there?'\n\n...\n\n'Hello...?'"
 XTI.1.a:0 "Hope for the best. Prepare for the worst."
 
 XTI.2.t:0 "What's Left"
 XTI.2.d:0 "Even from afar, it is readily apparent that there was little left. What was once a hub of social and political thought with a deep history is now just rubble. After several days of scavenging, the bunker entrances were found... open. It seems that they were either blown off or the survivors left many years too soon. Either way, whoever was once here is no longer alive."
 XTI.2.a:0 "What now?"
 
 XTI.3.t:0 "Tirol Invites us to the Alpine Alliance"

 XTI.3.b:0 "It's unwise to tie ourselves diplomatically."
 
 XTI.4.t:0 "First Postwar Elections"
 XTI.4.d:0 "After both internal and external pressures, the reclamation council has declared that the first elections will be held. The new system will be a parliamentary system with a prime minister at the head. Turnout was expectedly high and the outcome was close, but 3 parties are clearly dominant. The TVP is the moderate christian democracy party. They most resemble the Europe of old and prefer a relatively free market. Overall, they are a moderate conservative party with an anti-socialist stance. The primary left-leaning party is the SPT. They are social democrats who believe in justice and a strong hand in government. Although a declining party in the prewar times, they have successfully rebranded themselves as a more forward-looking party. Finally, the FPT is a right wing populist party who is interventionist and promotes a strong national identity. However, many are concerned about their harsh stances on many cultural issues. The race is still for anyone's taking. After days of counting, the winner is..."
