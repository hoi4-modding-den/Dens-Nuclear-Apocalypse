 #Ideas#
 XRP_deutsch_apartheid:0 "German Segregation"
 XRP_deutsch_apartheid_desc:0 "The Government of the Rhineland is primarily run by and for Americans, the descendants of the soldiers and officers who occupied the US military installations that peppered the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, prior to the Third World War. German 'civilians' are not granted the same protections, rights, or opportunities, as American 'citizens', and are generally seen as 'obstructive' at best by senior officers of the armed forces."

 #Characters
 XRP_Cavoli:0 "Gavin C. Cavoli"
 XRP_Cavoli_desc:0 "A distant descendant of Christopher G. Cavoli, who led EUCOM during the Third World War, Gavin C. Cavoli was trained from birth to eventually hold the office of 'Supreme Allied Commander', and has done so since 2230. Despite this, Cavoli has had a seeming lack of interest in military affairs, and has instead commanded more as a monarch than a true military leader, being more content to hold the spotlight and give speeches than actually command or even understand his role in the military. However, this arrangement is considered acceptable by high command due to him ‘rubber stamping’ any bills or commands given to him. Some in high command have had concerns that this arrangement could collapse if he ever takes a more firm stance on anything, but for now, everything is ‘smooth sailing’."
