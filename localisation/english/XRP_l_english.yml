 XRP_history_desc:0 "In the Rhineland, amongst the old ruins, of steel frames and pockmarked hills, lies a specter of Germany's past. \n \nHaving only barely survived the Third World War, the American descendants of the soldiers and officers in America’s military bases, have continually maintained their independence against the Germans since the nuclear winter lifted. By 2200, the Americans had expanded their borders to include the whole of Rhineland-Palatinate, in the name of “national defense”. But with the German population oppressed and rebellious, and the army already stretched to its limit, America will either have to change its ways, or be relegated to the German history books."

 #Sub-Ideologies#
 XRP_american_supremacism:0 "EUCOM"
 XRP_american_supremacism_long:0 "United States European Command"
 XRP_american_supremacism_desc:0 "American Supremacism is less a coherent, well-defined ideology, and more of the ‘logical conclusion’ to the concept of American Exceptionalism. Held by many Americans in Europe, American Supremacists view Americans as inherently better than other people, as Americans are inherently virtuous and loyal to the ideals of liberty, capitalism, and individualism. American Supremacists believe that the American way of life must be protected, by any means necessary, even at the cost of said liberties."
 XRP_american_republicanism:0 "Old Guard"
 XRP_american_republicanism_long:0 "Democratically Inclined Senior Officers"
 XRP_american_republicanism_desc:0 "American Republicanism is an ideology that seeks to establish a republic in the style of the old American government prior to the Third World War, believing that the American style of democracy was the reason for the United States being the most stable and powerful nation in history, and that it should be emulated to recapture its successes. American Republicanists aim to establish a strong presidency, an electoral college, a two party election system, and a neoliberal economic outlook." 
 
 #Ideas#
 XRP_deutsch_apartheid:0 "German Segregation"
 XRP_deutsch_apartheid_desc:0 "The Government of the Rhineland is primarily run by and for Americans, the descendants of the soldiers and officers who occupied the US military installations that peppered the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, prior to the Third World War. German 'civilians' are not granted the same protections, rights, or opportunities, as American 'citizens', and are generally seen as 'obstructive' at best by senior officers of the armed forces." 
 XRP_american_ideals:0 "Lingering Liberal Ideals"
 XRP_american_ideals_desc:0 "America was always held up as a 'shining beacon of liberty and democracy', starkly in contrast to our current military government. Despite our authoritarian leanings, many in our government still see us as upholding those standards, and wish to eventually transition our state to a more democratic government."
 XRP_radical_youth:0 "Disillusioned Cadets"
 XRP_radical_youth_desc:0 "Despite our propaganda efforts, the new generation of American soldiers seem to be increasingly disillusioned in both our military government and the ideals of democracy, seeing them as lies in the face of german oppression, and military service as a waste of their youth. While there's not much they can do about it currently, it could be a weakness if we are invaded from the north."
 XRP_economy_nuked:0 "Neglected Industral Capabilities"
 XRP_economy_nuked_desc:0 "Even ignoring how a significant portion of our factories were outright destroyed in the war, we simply don't have the technology to use many pre-war factories to their fullest extent."
 XRP_agarian_pop:0 "Undeveloped Rural Population"
 XRP_agarian_pop_desc:0 "Since the Third World War, the majority of our population has been forced to live an agarian lifestyle to survive. While our agarian development has some benefit, as it keeps the German population busy, it does not help our transition to a more modern industralized economy."
 
 #Characters
 XRP_Cavoli:0 "Gavin C. Cavoli"
 XRP_Cavoli_desc:0 "A distant descendant of Christopher G. Cavoli, who led EUCOM during the Third World War, Gavin C. Cavoli was trained from birth to eventually hold the office of 'Supreme Allied Commander', and has done so since 2230. Despite this, Cavoli has had a seeming lack of interest in military affairs, and has instead commanded more as a monarch than a true military leader, being more content to hold the spotlight and give speeches than actually command or even understand his role in the military. However, this arrangement is considered acceptable by high command due to him ‘rubber stamping’ any bills or commands given to him. Some in high command have had concerns that this arrangement could collapse if he ever takes a more firm stance on anything, but for now, everything is ‘smooth sailing’."
 XRP_Williams:0 "Marcus D. Williams"
 XRP_Williams_desc:0 "Descendant of General Darryl A. Williams, who led the U.S. Army Europe and Africa during the Third World War, Marcus D. Williams has taken over leadership of the country in the chaos of Cavoli’s assassination. Having graduated from Ramstine Military Academy in 2195, Williams served in the final conquests of the Rhineland, where he was established as a skilled commander in the Battle of Westerwaldkreis. Since then, he has entrenched himself in the army, having acted as one of the most democratically inclined generals, having pushed for more democratic reforms, but having been rejected on most efforts. With the democratic generals now in power, the American Rhineland can fully reform to a democratic republic, though some doubt how far Williams will actually take the reforms, or if elections will even occur."
