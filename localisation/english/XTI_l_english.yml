 XTI_reclamation_council_desc:0 "After the bombs were dropped, nuclear winter took over the surface. To survive these horrid conditions, many fled to the bunkers. Some of these people hid deep in the Alps and formed their own societies. After a couple of generations, the first settlers emerged from their hideouts. The goal is to reclaim tirol for the Austrians. However, the council in charge of the vault has unknown loyalties. Only time will tell which direction they will lead this new society."

 XTI_radio_silence:0 "Radio Silence"

 XTI_vienna_expedition:0 "Vienna Expedition"

 XTI_the_new_tiroleans:0 "The New Tiroleans"
 XTI_the_new_tiroleans_desc:0 "Vienna is reduced to rubble. Few survivors lie beyond our lands. There is little point to spend all of our resources on desolate wasteland. It is time for a new generation who doesn't waste time on the past."
 XTI_the_bridge:0 "The Bridge"
 XTI_the_bridge_desc:0 "Despite the relatively good condition of the small resort town of Innsbruck, it has still been over 100 years since the last major renovation.

 XTI_new_highways:0 "New Highways"

 XTI_reopen_prewar_roads:0 "Repave Prewar Roads"
 XTI_reopen_prewar_roads_desc:0 "Asphalt has a short lifespan when neglected. The cities, once easily navigable, has resembled more of a warzone. These roads must be stripped and repaved throughout the country."

 ### EVENTS ###
 
 XTI.1.t:0 "Silence From Vienna"
 XTI.1.d:0 "'Hello? Hello! This is the head of the vaults of Tirol. Vienna command, are you there?'\n\n...\n\n'Hello...?'"
 XTI.1.a:0 "Hope for the best. Prepare for the worst."
 
 XTI.2.t:0 "What's Left"
 XTI.2.d:0 "Even from afar, it is readily apparent that there was little left. What was once a hub of social and political thought with a deep history is now just rubble. After several days of scavenging, the bunker entrances were found... open. It seems that they were either blown off or the survivors left many years too soon. Either way, whoever was once here is no longer alive."
 XTI.2.a:0 "What now?"
