 XDA_Mouhamed_Talib_II_nonaligned_desc:0 "After the atomic bombing, a bunch of cats, in a laboratory in Marocco, which were tested to see how human DNA would change their evolution, gained the ability to survive radiation and be as smart as humans. After finding a Quran in an abandoned house, Talib I and his cat brothers decided to adopt Islam as their official religion. Talib I after landing in what was once Gibraltar expanded into the rest of southern Iberia. Talib I was not immortal and as such he got ill and died, Now Talib II rules the country, but the people don't support him since he lost a war in northern Marocco."
