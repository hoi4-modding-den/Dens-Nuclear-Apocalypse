XGL_antonio_costa_desc:0 "António Costa, the leader of Portugal in the 2010s - years ago - had been assumed dead after his peaceful passing years after his impeachment due to corruption allegations. With the technology at the time, the mid-60s was not a peak age to die at. That's to say, he never died.\n\nCryogenic sleep is no stranger to topics within sci-fi stories and such, but nobody figured it had been achieved at that time. With such a device, António slept the next hundreds of years away, preserving his elder ages. As the bombs dropped and the dust settled, his cryopod released him from his icy cage nearly 200 years later.\n\nNow, with his charisma and political knowledge, the people in the previously unclaimed area rallied under his name - or, whatever land he could claim before tribes and false republics around could take. Now, António lives again, free from allegations.\n\n"Esta é a ditosa Pátria minha amada." This is my blissful beloved Fatherland."
