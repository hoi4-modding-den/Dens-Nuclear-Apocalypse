 XSK_history: "The Second Ottoman Sultanate was established by the liberated Uyghur people after the Great Cataclysm. With the recent death of Sultan Süleyman the Eleventh, a regency council has been established to find a worthy successor. Their choice lies between the incompetent nephew of the deceased sultan or his illigitimate son, but if the Regency takes too long to make their decision, the military might have to interfere."
