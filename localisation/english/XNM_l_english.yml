 ### National Spirits ###
 XNM_compromise_of_29:0 "Compromise of 29'"
 XNM_compromise_of_29_desc:0 "As the 2230 Elections were coming up, the unstable coalition of the United Democrats of Mercia, also known as the §CUDM§!, fragmented as each faction decided to pursue its own interests. Fearing that this could lead to the rise of extremism in the Republic, the §2New Dawn Party§! worked hard to rebuild relations among the bygone partners. However, this effort came at a significant cost, leading to numerous compromises and allowing the conservatives, also known as the §1UC§!, to dictate the majority of terms. Today, the coalition is attempting to regain its strength and counteract its declining influence, though even a minor spark could trigger another major crisis within the coalition." 
 XNM_midlands_protests:0 "Midlands Protests"
 XNM_midlands_protests_desc:0 "Although the renewal of the dominant coalition, the §CUDM§!, has gathered a great amount of public support within a majority of the Republic's regions, the new reforms proposed by the §2New Dawn Party§!, which purposefully target the influence of nationalist and monarchist sympathizers, have faced a lot of backlashes. In reaction, the nationalists within the §LNational Mercian Front§! as well as the §gIclingatists§!, both united in a counter-coalition under the guise of the §0Ultraroyalist League§!. With the rise of this direct challenge to the current long-standing dominance of the §CUDM§!, the §0UL§! has reinforced its efforts to combat the system, by organizing massive riots in their home region of the West Midlands, in which a large number of citizens advocate for the reinstitution of the forgotten monarchy." 
 XNM_midlands_protests_light:0 "Midlands Protests"
 XNM_midlands_protests_light_desc:0 "Although the renewal of the dominant coalition, the §CUDM§!, has gathered a great amount of public support within a majority of the Republic's regions, the new reforms proposed by the §2New Dawn Party§!, which purposefully target the influence of nationalist and monarchist sympathizers, have faced a lot of backlashes.

 XNM_tensions_on_the_trent:0 "Tensions on the Trent"
 XNM_tensions_on_the_trent_desc:0 "The River Trent has always served as a barrier permitting the continuing existence of the current status quo of the Mercian Republic and New New England. However, in the past years, the aggressive policies of Winston Chamberlain have led to increased pressure throughout the southern border regions. This varied from simple military demonstrations near the borders to unexpected territorial incursions. According to the Mercian National Agency, it is only a matter of time before New New London attempts at a full-scale invasion of the Republic."
 XNM_undergoing_army_modernization:0 "Undergoing Army Modernization"
 XNM_undergoing_army_modernization_desc:0 "With the increased technological exchanges between Tyne Corp. and the Merican Republic, the Gainsborough Administration has put forward a program favoring a complete overhaul of the military. Although it may bear its fruits later on, the decision to begin this modernization is quite critiqued as it may prove to be disastrous if the territorial integrity of Mercia was to be violated during the rejuvenation efforts."
 XNM_albion_booming_heart:0 "Albion's Booming Heart"
 XNM_albion_booming_heart_desc:0 "Even with the chaos and destruction that unfolded after the Nuclear Apocalypse in the 21st century, ever since its humble beginnings, the Mercian Republic has always strived for an economic priority and advantage over its foreign counterparts. This is quite well represented today as the Republic stands firm as one of, if not the greatest industrial power of this post-fallout world. With the economic prowess of Mercia seemingly not reducing anytime soon, the current administration must seek to expand it with any means necessary while also maintaining the resource-hungry machine to continue the "Grand Efforts" made by our predecessors in 2204."
 BEZ_membership:0 "B.E.Z. Membership"
 BEZ_membership_desc:0 "The Britannia Economic Zone was founded as a result of the evolving relations between the Mercian Republic and The Tynes. However, today, the trade organization seeks to prosper and bring back an era of globalization, from concocting trade and tariffs agreements to aiding the development of new member countries."

 ### Events ###
 XNM_focus.1.title:0 "Gainsborough's Trip"
 XNM_focus.1.desc:0 "Over the past few days, President Arthur Gainsborough has traveled around the central regions of the country to promote the re-election campaign of the New Dawn Party and the larger UDM coalition as a whole. Although the president received overwhelming support in both the Yorkshire and Lancashire regions, there proved to be hefty resistance to his speech in Repton, as monarchist sympathizers and far-right activists blamed Gainsborough for abandoning Mercia's tradition and culture due to his planned inclusion plan, which aims to create an equal society between both mutants and humans."
 XNM_focus.1.a:0 "For democracy, for the Republic!"
 XNM_country.1.title:0 "Midlands Situation out of Control"
 XNM_country.1.desc:0 "It has been reported that the activity within the West Midlands region has recently picked up a lot of steam due to the upcoming elections and the violence used against protesters within many districts of the city of Repton. However, it seems as if the rioters have gained momentum seized many arms depots in the area, and prevented the movements of our larger and more capable forces. Due to this development, Gainsborough has reinforced the local forces and has doubled down on the pacification of the region."
 XNM_country.1.a:0 "Send the local police reinforcements."

 XNM_news.1.title:0 "Midlands Crisis in Mercia"
 XNM_news.1.desc:0 "It has been announced today in the early morning at 6:42AM by a decleration of press of the Gainsborough Administration that the volatile situation surrounding the Midlands Protests have completely spiraled out of control. Although originally based in Repton, the pro-monarchist movement has now gathered the support of the local nationalists in West Midlands, which rendered any police action practically useless. In light of these recent developments, the Republic's President, Arthur Gainsborough, is expected to make a decision on how to proceed with the situation in the coming days. In recent news, arriving reports from the Mercia counter-intelligence office has assigned a possible connections between the violent revolts in the Midlands and the government of [XNE.GetName], which could only mean an escelation of tensions between both foreign powers if proven to be true."
