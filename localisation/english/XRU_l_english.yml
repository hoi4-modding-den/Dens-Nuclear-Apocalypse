# Leaders
XRU_Dimitry_Sydor:0 "Dimitry Sydor"
XRU_Dimitry_Sydor_desc:0 "Dimitry Sydor feels empty inside. His days as an archpriest made him believe that God was on the side of the Rusyns in taking back their homeland and more, but now, the frozen state he has created begins to thaw. Sydor feels a sense of dread overcome him - it will not be much longer until disaster strikes."
XRU_Gabriel_Bosko:0 "Gabriel Bosko"
XRU_Gabriel_Bosko_desc:0 "Gabriel Bosko was raised to be a soldier. His mother died in childbirth - his father died in combat. His uncle, the most rage-filled man Bosko ever met, took him under his wing. Luckily, his uncle only directed his rage towards the Rusyns, who quickly seized control of Slovak territory in an uprising. Now, Bosko fights for more than just his uncle, his mother, and his father - he fights for all of Slovakia. And there isn't a thing he won't do to win back their freedom."
XRU_Revolutionary:0 "Revolutionary"
XRU_Revolutionary_desc:0 "So little is known about the man who tore the Rusyn State asunder. His name is most certainly not "Revolutionary", but there is no other name known for him to be called, and so his enemies are forced to call him an ideological crusader, much to his delight. Although his underlings are also in the shadows, none of their identities remain as hidden as their leader's. Revolutionary has plans - big plans. Plans the rest of Eastern Europe might be unprepared for."

# Events
XRU.start_1.t:0 "Cold Night in the Church"
XRU.start_1.d:0 "The wind howled outside of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior. It had been lucky enough to survive the atomic bombing, and it had only been expanded after Rusyn rule began, now being the largest building in Transcarpathia. At this hour, however, very few people were here - five security guards positioned around the building, and one man inside, praying silently. Dimitry Sydor was his name, and he had been coming here to pray every night after hearing of the Bratislava Massacre. But Dimitry felt as if his prayers were not being answered - no miracle had yet come to save him from the hell he was bound to fall into when his authority collapsed. Sighing, Dimitry would stand up, walking towards the door. It was only a matter of time - he was a dead man walking."
XRU.start_1.a:0 "§RI never would have expected him to be correct about anything.§!"

XRU.start_2.t:0 "Cold Night in the Alleyway"
XRU.start_2.d:0 "The wind howled too, within the large alleyway in Bratislava where the scout was watching. A member of the Slovak Militarist Union for Liberation, he had been sent to scout out the defenses of the city, along with a few other scouts in various other alleyways. His findings were so optimistic that he almost laughed out loud and gave away his position. The Rusyns had almost completely dwindled down their military occupation of Bratislava. The scout was certain that the same could be said for the other cities. It was time for revolution!"
XRU.start_2.a:0 "§RIn a sense, he is right. In another, he is ruined.§!"

XRU.start_3.t:0 "Doom"
XRU.start_3.d:0 "Dimitry Sydor carefully creaked open the door to the palace. He had lived here for years, but now every time he came home he felt like he was entering somewhere foreign and unsafe. Frankly, Dimitry didn't feel safe anywhere anymore. He started up the long, long flight of stairs to the plateau of the lobby, and was almost halfway up when he heard the gunshots. *My God! The damned Slovak hellions! They're here!* Dimitry began to scramble up the stairs madly, as the gunshots eventually subsided. He was almost at the top when he made a bad step, falling and twisting his ankle. He screamed in pain, but refused to stop his ascent, now pulling himself up steps with his arms. By the time he reached the top, he lifted himself up, only to meet the barrel of the muzzle. Dimitry would have smiled if he had seen the face of a young Slovak boy, ready to deliver his inevitable fate. But instead, one of his own bodyguards stood over him, wearing a strange mask painted with orthodox crosses and ritualistic symbols. The bodyguard stared Dimitry down for a moment, before lowering the pistol. "You...you're a Rusyn! Is this not what you wanted?" Dimitry managed to sputter out, feeling the world spin around him. This wasn't how it was supposed to go! The man chuckled slightly, picking Dimitry up by the neck with alarming ease. "Oh no, Dimitry...this is exactly what we have wanted for quite some time." The man then lifted Dimitry over his head and chucked him down the flight of stairs. Dimitry's screams cut short after he smashed into the ground. It was only then that he lay still. The bodyguard grinned, taking off their mask and placing the gun onto the roof of their mouth before firing. His purpose was complete."
XRU.start_3.a:0 "§RBehold, the rise of the mastermind.§!"
XRU.start_3.b:0 "For liberation! For Slovakia!"
XRU.start_3.c:0 "Order must be maintained at all costs!"

Rusyn.1.d:0 "This morning, news came of disaster in the Rusyn State - partisans and communists had split the country in three, forcing it to descend into anarchy as all three sides fight to control the whole state. The victor of this conflict could undoubtedly upset the balance of power in Eastern Europe..."
