 XKR_intro_loc:0 "Before the bombs dropped, casinos across Europe had formed a network to prevent new competition and raise the prices of hotels and casinos on the continent. §YContigency plans were drawn up by the group in the event of government takeovers, attacks from rivals, and importantly nuclear devastation§!. As the bombs were falling, the four great families as well as some more minor families who owned the casinos met in the §Ymountains of Austria§! as they hoped it would give them protection from the ensuing nuclear fallout. The group enacted §Rplan 777 'JACKPOT'§!.\n\nTheir plan led them to find a new location to rebuild their casino empires, and after months of searching, the group came to the devastated and abandoned port city of §YGdańsk§!. Figuring this was a blank canvas to form a new empire out of the ashes, they began construction of the §YGrande Casino§! and tore down old buildings to make way for a §Gnew casino metropolis§!.\n\nIn the years that have passed, the four families reign over their new realm and are known as the §gAces§!, §RHearts§!, §gClubs§!, and §RDiamonds§!. While these four families form the ruling council, the §gAces§! ultimately have the final say. It is a time of splendor and excess, §Rpitting families against each other, each looking for weakness, waiting to strike§!.   \n\n§HCurrent Content:§! \n\n §G-Navigate intricate family politics.\n -Serve Europe as a refuge from its §Yharsh realities§G.\n -Grow the §YGrande Casino§! to §5heights unseen since the bombs dropped!§!"
