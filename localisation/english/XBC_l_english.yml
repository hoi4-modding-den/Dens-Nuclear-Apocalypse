 XBC_history_desc:0 "Despite being oficially disbanded in 2018, the ETA has survived in the underground, and after the Apocalypse has established a free and independent Basque state. For over a century it was able to maintain an isolationst, auhoritarian government.\n\nHowever, a wind of change can be felt in the Pyrenees. The ETA is now split into various factions, ranging from communist Left to ultranationalist Right. There is also a vocal group of democratic activists, who wish to abolish the dictatorship and stop the repressions of Spanish people. Time will tell, which vision of a Basque state shall emerge victorious..."
