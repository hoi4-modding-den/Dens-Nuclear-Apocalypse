 ### Introduction Event ###
 XNM_intro_loc:0 "As the radiation on the surface began to settle, the people of Liuerpul, previously known as the grand city of Liverpool , began to surface from both their bunkers as well as their barricaded shacks. Since then, contact was able to be established between the various towns and remnants of the countryside, in which the §HRepublic of Mercia§! was officially founded as one of the §Hfirst political entity of this post-apocalyptic world.§! Following this grand success, the republic expanded to include the diverse variety of both humans and mutants, which today remains on of the core topics of Mercia.\n\nYet, in recent times, tensions have been rising both internally and externally, seen by the rise of §gpro-monarchist sentiments§! in the South as well as the fear of an incoming warmonger over the Trent River. It is up to the §CUDM§!, the current §2ruling democratic coalition§!, to §Hrestore the Republic to its golden era§! and repeal any foreign and domestic threats or crumble under the pressure. With many proposals being passed to try and salvage the situation such as the §HCompromise of 29'§! as well as the New Dawn Party being increasingly divided between the liberals and the minority conservatives, the future is uncertain. It may seem as Mercia may one day restructure its government in order to preserve its independence or even to expand its borders like never seen before. \n\n§HCurrent Content:§! \n\n §G-Save the Republic through liberal and conservative values.\n -Seek a return of the §Hancient Mercian monarchy§! and national pride.\n -Unite the §HBritish Isles§! through §7cooperation§! or §twarfare.§!"

 ### Bookmark History ###
 XNM_bookmark_history:0 "While the bombs destroyed a nation, it never destroyed its spirit, which is the main reason the Mercian Republic was founded shortly after the fallout came to an end and the world revived once more. £GFX_XNM_propoganda However, after the 'Glorious Century' which followed the Republic's proclamation, the once prosperous Republic of Mercia now is at a standstill, while it has proven to still posses numerous economic capabilities, on the geopolitical and domestic sphere, it has drasticall weakened over the past years, which sees possibilities for powergrabs, coups, but also the possibility that the Republic would survive this dark era and enter a new age.

 XNM_compromise_of_29:0 "Compromise of 29'"
 XNM_compromise_of_29_desc:0 "As the 2230 Elections were coming up, the unstable coalition of the United Democrats of Mercia, also known as the §CUDM§!, fragmented as each faction decided to pursue its own interests. Fearing that this could lead to the rise of extremism in the Republic, the §2New Dawn Party§! worked hard to rebuild relations among the bygone partners. However, this effort came at a significant cost, leading to numerous compromises and allowing the conservatives, also known as the §1UC§!, to dictate the majority of terms. Today, the coalition is attempting to regain its strength and counteract its declining influence, though even a minor spark could trigger another major crisis within the coalition." 
 XNM_midlands_protests:0 "Midlands Protests"
 XNM_midlands_protests_desc:0 "Although the renewal of the dominant coalition, the §CUDM§!, has gathered a great amount of public support within a majority of the Republic's regions, the new reforms proposed by the §2New Dawn Party§!, which purposefully target the influence of nationalist and monarchist sympathizers, have faced a lot of backlashes. In reaction, the nationalists within the §LNational Mercian Front§! as well as the §gIclingatists§!, both united in a counter-coalition under the guise of the §0Ultraroyalist League§!. With the rise of this direct challenge to the current long-standing dominance of the §CUDM§!, the §0UL§! has reinforced its efforts to combat the system, by organizing massive riots in their home region of the West Midlands, in which a large number of citizens advocate for the reinstitution of the forgotten monarchy."

 XNM_tensions_on_the_trent:0 "Tensions on the Trent"
 XNM_tensions_on_the_trent_desc:0 "The River Trent has always served as a barrier permitting the continuing existence of the current status quo of the Mercian Republic and New New England. However, in the past years, the aggressive policies of Winston Chamberlain have led to increased pressure throughout the southern border regions. This varied from simple military demonstrations near the borders to unexpected territorial incursions. According to the Mercian National Agency, it is only a matter of time before New New London attempts at a full-scale invasion of the Republic."
 XNM_undergoing_army_modernization:0 "Undergoing Army Modernization"
 XNM_undergoing_army_modernization_desc:0 "With the increased technological exchanges between Tyne Corp. and the Merican Republic, the Gainsborough Administration has put forward a program favoring a complete overhaul of the military. Although it may bear its fruits later on, the decision to begin this modernization is quite critiqued as it may prove to be disastrous if the territorial integrity of Mercia was to be violated during the rejuvenation efforts."
 XNM_albion_booming_heart:0 "Albion's Booming Heart"
 XNM_albion_booming_heart_desc:0 "Even with the chaos and destruction that unfolded after the Nuclear Apocalypse in the 21st century, ever since its humble beginnings, the Mercian Republic has always strived for an economic priority and advantage over its foreign counterparts. This is quite well represented today as the Republic stands firm as one of, if not the greatest industrial power of this post-fallout world. With the economic prowess of Mercia seemingly not reducing anytime soon, the current administration must seek to expand it with any means necessary while also maintaining the resource-hungry machine to continue the "Grand Efforts" made by our predecessors in 2204."

 XNM_focus.1.desc:0 "Over the past few days, President Arthur Gainsborough has traveled around the central regions of the country to promote the re-election campaign of the New Dawn Party and the larger UDM coalition as a whole. Although the president received overwhelming support in both the Yorkshire and Lancashire regions, there proved to be hefty resistance to his speech in Repton, as monarchist sympathizers and far-right activists blamed Gainsborough for abandoning Mercia's tradition and culture due to his planned inclusion plan, which aims to create an equal society between both mutants and humans."
 XNM_focus.1.a:0 "For democracy, for the Republic!"
 XNM_country.1.title:0 "Midlands Situation out of Control"
 XNM_country.1.desc:0 "It has been reported that the activity within the West Midlands region has recently picked up a lot of steam due to the upcoming elections and the violence used against protesters within many districts of the city of Repton. However, it seems as if the rioters have gained momentum seized many arms depots in the area, and prevented the movements of our larger and more capable forces. Due to this development, Gainsborough has reinforced the local forces and has doubled down on the pacification of the region."
 XNM_country.1.a:0 "Send the local police reinforcements."
 XNM_country.2.title:0 "Local Governmental Collapse in Repton"
 XNM_country.2.desc:0 "The temporary measures that we have recently put in place in order to try an contain the resurgent threat in the Lowland Region has faced much backlash while experiencing low success. It all crumbled down in the recent days as both the local police and governmental bodies in the area have completely and tragically collapsed. In contrary to popular belief, it seems as the pro-monarchist and nationalist sentiments which have caused instability have only kept rising due to various factors. However, according to an investigation made by the Mercian Intelligence Bureau, there is an alledged involvement of [XNE.GetName], which could serve as another proof that [XNE.GetName] has officially started to meddle with Mercian internal affairs, which could serve as proof that something darker may loom over the horizon, yet it could also be a untrue statement, the possibilities are endless."

Although originally based in Repton, the pro-monarchist movement has now gathered the support of the local nationalists in West Midlands, which rendered any police action practically useless. In light of these recent developments, the Republic's President, Arthur Gainsborough, is expected to make a decision on how to proceed with the situation in the coming days. In recent news, arriving reports from the Mercian Intelligence Bureau has assigned a possible connections between the violent revolts in the Midlands and the government of [XNE.GetName], which could only mean an escelation of tensions between both foreign powers if proven to be true."
