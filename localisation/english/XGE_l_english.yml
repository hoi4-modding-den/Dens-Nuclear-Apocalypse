The Operating System is very archaic, merely consisting of a simple terminal input and the face of the long-forgotten East German dictator Erich Honecker. Typing in to the terminal and sending it will yield a response from Honecker to whatever the user had typed in. This piece of technology has formed an entire following around it, with millions of people following a computer's orders with no hesitation or further questions."

All credibility of the systems of the old times vanished alongside the many people that died in the most devastating conflict known to mankind, leading to the survivors turning towards demagogues advertising them about ideologies that were more and more lunatic than before, ideologies that swore to turn the mere ruins of the once prospering German nation to something better, something that couldn't be destroyed so easily...\n\nMaximillian Weiß was one of those people who wanted to rebuild what was once lost in a mere matter of seconds. He was the one who discovered the Kybernetik Betriebssystem from the rubbles of old Berlin, a computer program that begun to guide him and the people around it, seemigly enchanting them with promises of economic prosperity and egletarianism. It seemed that the machine knew better than the so-called humane leaders that had once ruled them, the Operating System clearly being programmed to make decisions that seemed to only benefit humanity.\n\n§HCurrent Content:§! \n\n §G-Rebuild the devastated German society.\n -Realize a Neo-German Democratic Republic.\n -Reunify the nation under the§! §6Kybernetik Betriebssystem.§!"

 XGE.5.t:0 "The Socialist Reunification of Germany"
 XGE.5.d:0 "After the nuclear hellfire and the total collapse of the previous German administration, a radical leftist movement has fully conquered the lands of what once was the German Federal Republic. It is believed that this very nation is being headed by a computer program which is ideologically aligned towards Marxism-Leninism. \n\nIt is unclear how this singular program is able to maintain control of the entire nation, but what is known is that the machine rules the country with an iron fist. What this means for the future of the region is up for debate."

 XGE.6.t:0 "The Trial"
 XGE.6.d:0 "Marius was only capable of looking the concrete wall that stood behind the judge. It was evident that his fate had already been sealed, as his lawyer had effectively done nothing to defend his case. "These Judeo-Bolsheviks were after blood, looking to merely strangle the few German men that stood up against them", Marius thought to himself, right before the judge turned his gaze towards the National Socialist in the defender's seat. \n\n"Life in prison would be too light for you," The judge staunchily claimed, and the large crowd that had been invited to the trials cheered, to which Marius didn't respond in any way. He wasn't going to listen to what he believed were merely lies and deceit from a Jewish agent. The judge wasn't worthy of his Aryan respect, and neither were any of the other communist subhumans that shared the courtroom with him. To Marius, the judge was a lowlife, a dirty conspirator looking to exterminate the purity of the German master race. "Mr. Fischer, if you're not going to argue against the ruling of the court, there is only one thing I can enforce", the Judge roared, only catalyzing the crowd's cheering even more."
 XGE.6.a:0 ""Court Officers, excecute Mr. Fischer", the judge declared."
 XGE.7.t:0 "The Fate of the Fascist Occupiers"
 XGE.7.d:0 ""What I suggest is the death penalty for their leaders and their enablers," the Operating System answered as Maximillian had asked the machine about what to do regarding the captured American officers. "What counts as an enabler?" Weiss typed into the input box, to which the Cybernetic Operating System responded with: "Anyone who didn't actively oppose the reign of fascism and reactionary capitalism within the Rheinland-Palatinate. They don't deserve our mercy... the collaborators and colonialists, I mean.""
 XGE.7.a:0 "The computer has spoken"
 XGE.8.t:0 "An Alternate Interpretation"
 XGE.8.d:0 ""The DDR is not communist, or even socialist to any extent," the dissident said as she was being interrogated by two members of the feared 'Stasi'. "The workers don't have the rights to the fruits of their labour... I have seen what is happening within the VEB factory, those labourers are being exploited just as much as in... say, Mercia, or Burgundy. It's mere red fascism that you're practicing over Germany," She explained, before one of the men slams their fists against the table that separated the two parties. \n\n"Enough! You've shown us that you're just as gullible to reactionary propaganda as any other liberal. If you actually went to the factories yourself, you would see how happy our people are. We feed them, we pay them more than in any other nation in the world, and all of them are members of an independent trade union," He said, with spit storming out of his mouth as he passionately defended his homeland. \n\n"How can you say that when you're actively oppressing the common worker. The Stasi is nothing short of a fascist organization! The only thing you've created is more ideological prisioners and a massive class of lumpenproletariat," She countered."
 XGE.8.a:0 ""She can not be rehabilited. Lock her up," He commanded the other officer."
 XGE.9.t:0 "Religion and the SUPNG"
 XGE.9.d:0 ""Dear Operating System, what should we do regarding the many churches we have in our country?" Maximillian asked the digitalized variant of the late Erich Honecker. "Religion is the opium of the masses. Close down the churches, and every other place of spirituality. They are merely harbours of the opressors, looking to corrupt our communist society," the system responded sharply, to which engineer Weiss nodded as a response. "I understand, dear Operating System. Should we enforce atheism in our state?" He typed into the terminal. "Yes, state atheism is a must in our society. Religion is a relic of the past, a tool used by the reactionaries.""
 XGE.9.a:0 "The issue is settled"
 XGE.10.t:0 "Election Results"
 XGE.10.d:0 "59% of the casted votes were in favour of the Socialist Party, which was a very good result on it's own. With that being said, those numbers look even better when you take into account that the electoral alliance the SUPNG was a member of, 'The National Front', received 100% of the votes. Our new election system was sketched by our very own Cybernetic Operation System, where effectively you have parties that differ from the SUPNG by their name, but which effectively are a mere extension of the Socialist Party's rule."
 XGE.10.a:0 "No Social Fascism or Liberalism in sight!"
