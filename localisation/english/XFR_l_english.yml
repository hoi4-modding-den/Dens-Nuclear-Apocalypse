XFR_intro_loc: "The §YRepublic of Burgundy§! is a relatively young nation, having only been established a few hundred years ago, when a group of settlers came across records from the §YOld World§!. They began building a nation based on the principles of the §YFrench Republic§!, striving to restore it once the time was right.\n\nBut there were also those with other goals in mind. The §Y"Lotharingians"§! wanted to instead return even further back, planning for an §Yauthoritarian regime§! based on records of something called "Ordenstaat Burgund" which to them seemed like a later iteration of §YLotharingia§!. But even among those kinds of people, there were some with something even more extreme in mind.\n\nThe §YHerzog von Burgund§!, Julius Zimmermann, wanted to be the lone ruler of all of Europe. To legitimise his dreams, he adopted the name Karolinger, an ancient Old World royal house, and pretended to decend from them, claiming to restore the §YFrankish Empire§! for the good of Europe.\n\n§CCurrent Country Paths:§!\n \n§O - Restore the Sixth French Republic or a French Federation\n - Rebuild a Karolingian Empire§!"
