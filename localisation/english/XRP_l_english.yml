 XRP_history_desc:0 "In the Rhineland, amongst the old ruins, of steel frames and pockmarked hills, lies a specter of Germany's past. \n \nHaving only barely survived the Third World War, the American descendants of the soldiers and officers in America’s military bases, have continually maintained their independence against the Germans since the nuclear winter lifted. By 2200, the Americans had expanded their borders to include the whole of Rhineland-Palatinate, in the name of “national defense”. But with the German population oppressed and rebellious, and the army already stretched to its limit, America will either have to change its ways, or be relegated to the German history books."

 XRP_american_supremacism_long:0 "United States European Command"
 XRP_american_supremacism_desc:0 "American Supremacism is less a coherent, well-defined ideology, and more of the ‘logical conclusion’ to the concept of American Exceptionalism. Held by many Americans in Europe, American Supremacists view Americans as inherently better than other people, as Americans are inherently virtuous and loyal to the ideals of liberty, capitalism, and individualism. American Supremacists believe that the American way of life must be protected, by any means necessary, even at the cost of said liberties."

American Republicanists aim to establish a strong presidency, an electoral college, a two party election system, and a neoliberal economic outlook."

 #Characters#
 XRP_Cavoli:0 "Gavin C. Cavoli"
 XRP_Cavoli_desc:0 "A distant descendant of Christopher G. Cavoli, who led EUCOM during the Third World War, Gavin C. Cavoli was 'trained' from birth to eventually hold the office of 'Supreme Allied Commander', and has done so since 2230, following the death of the previous commander. Despite this, Cavoli has had a seeming lack of interest in military affairs, and has instead commanded more as a monarch than a true military leader, being more content to hold the spotlight and give speeches than actually command or even understand his role in the military. However, this arrangement is considered acceptable by high command due to him ‘rubber stamping’ any bills or commands given to him. Some in high command have had concerns that this arrangement could collapse if he ever takes a more firm stance on anything, but for now, everything is ‘smooth sailing’."
 XRP_Williams:0 "Marcus D. Williams"
 XRP_Williams_desc:0 "Descendant of General Darryl A. Williams, who led the U.S. Army Europe and Africa during the Third World War, Marcus D. Williams has taken over leadership of the country in the chaos of Cavoli’s assassination. Having graduated from Ramstine Military Academy in 2195, Williams served in the final conquests of the Rhineland, where he was established as a skilled commander in the Battle of Westerwaldkreis. Since then, he has entrenched himself in the army, having acted as one of the most democratically inclined generals, having pushed for more democratic reforms, but having been rejected on most efforts. With the democratic generals now in power, the American Rhineland can fully reform to a democratic republic, though some doubt how far Williams will actually take the reforms, or if elections will even occur."

 XRP.NE_1.t:0 "The American Occupation Zone"
 XRP.NE_1.d:0 "Ever since the end of the Second World War in 1945, the United States armed forces has maintained one of the largest overseas military detachments in the world in Western Germany. All with one goal in mind — to guarantee American control over Germany, either against the Germans in the Second World War, or with the Germans in the Third World War. \n\n 'The State of Rhineland-Palatinate', as it was formerly known, was placed directly under the martial law of the 'United States European Command' following the outbreak of the Third World War. Only through a combination of the enemy's poor maintenance of their nuclear arsenal, experimental anti-nuclear satellites, and pure luck, that Ramstein Air Base avoided being reduced to just a memory of a mushroom cloud. The Americans who survived the cataclysm lied in wait in their bunkers, coming out from the dust around 2050 to a world reduced to tribalism. These stranded Americans rebuilt Ramstein Air Base into a true American-style city, and the large surplus of modern military equipment meant the Americans were always a step ahead of the nearby Germans, who had become nearly feudalistic in the aftermath of the war. Ramstein would become a full nation-state in its own right, asserting itself in the world in the face of attempted invasions from neighboring German city-states. These cities ultimately failed to assert control over Ramstein, and would in-turn be conquered themselves over the course of the 22nd century. With the full 'reconquest' of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate around 2200 fueling expansionist appetites within the Rhinish government, the American forces have been further radicalized by the recent rise of the anarchists and the techno-communists to the north. These 'commie bastards' only further solidified what the military high-command always knew, that the German people cannot be trusted to run themselves. However, with American forces already over-stretched from the occupation of the whole state, and the German population here becoming increasingly recalcitrant to American governance, it's clear that something has to change."

 XRP.NE_2.d:0 "A young cadet sat at his table, watching the kitchen staff as they ran in and out of the kitchen, getting meals out to the hundreds of other cadets in the commons room.\n\n‘‘Is there something on your mind, Matt?’’\n\n‘‘What?’’ asked Matthew, failing to feign ignorance of how he looked.\n\n‘‘Hey, I know how you are, somethings on your mind... Also, you haven’t even touched your cornbread yet.’’\n\n‘‘You can have it,’’ said Matt, as he returned to his observation.\n\nThe kitchen staff briefly conversed in German, something about a table, what little Matthew knew of German didn’t help with the distance. Quickly, the waiter rushed back into the kitchen...\n\n‘‘Is it the Germans?’’ asked the friend, ‘‘I wouldn’t worry about it,’’\n\n‘‘Wouldn’t worry about it? We practically use them as slaves,’’ said Matt frustratedly, ‘‘Didn’t we fight a war over this?’’\n\nThe waiter ran out of the kitchen, drink tray in hand. Just from the direction alone, Matt could tell he was heading to the officer’s table, just a few yards apart from the rest of the tables.\n\n‘‘Yeah, it’s bad, but what can you do?’’ said the friend.\n\nA crash sounds through the hall, and one of the sargents stands up, a wet stain adorning his suit. \n\n‘‘You Nazi bastard, do you have any idea how much this coat cost!’’ Shouted the sergeant, walking over to the waiter on the ground. ‘‘This is coming out of YOUR paycheck, ‘Deutscher’!’’, he shouted as he kicked the waiter in the gut. As he walked back to his seat, the silence of the room became obvious, and the other Cadets slowly went back to eating, as if nothing ever happened."

 XRP.NE_3.t:0 "Germans March on Ramstein" #Standard
 XRP.NE_3.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of the American military government to maintain security, tensions have reached a breaking point. While few expected the German population to gracefully accept the increasingly harsh and expendable treatment that they have been put under, nobody quite realized just how volatile the situation really was. With support for the military government at an all-time low, in part due to the heavy-handed nature of many of our ‘‘reforms’’ having alienated some of our American support base. \n\nNonetheless, what started out as a simple dispute in the small city of Trier almost instantly escalated into a series of riots throughout the nation. The armed force’s typical response of brutal retaliation had the opposite effect from usual, only fanning the flames on a fire that was growing out of control. Mutinies in the army followed, as the low-ranking soldiers refused to fire on the German civilians. \n\nOver the course of about 48 hours, American authority completely collapsed in the Rhineland, as Ramstein and Spangdahlem bases struggled to maintain order in their own barracks. The message was clear: the oppression of Germans would no longer be tolerated. A German militia had formed outside Ramstein, determined to end the violent regime once and for all. American high-command, sensing the inevitable, quickly took whatever gold and cash they had, and boarded a flight to Switzerland, hoping that the Swiss would recognize pre-war American treaties instead of an ‘‘illegal revolt’’. As sympathetic cadets opened the gates, German forces overran the bases and tore up the command centers. After over a hundred years of American rule, The Rhineland is now German once again."

With support for the military government at an all-time low, in part due to the heavy-handed nature of many of our ‘‘reforms’’ having alienated some of our American support base. \n\nNonetheless, what started out as a simple dispute in the small city of Trier almost instantly escalated into a series of riots throughout the nation. The armed force’s typical response of brutal retaliation had the opposite effect from usual, only fanning the flames on a fire that was growing out of control. Mutinies in the army followed, as the low-ranking soldiers refused to fire on the German civilians. \n\nOver the course of about 48 hours, American authority completely collapsed in the Rhineland, as Ramstein and Spangdahlem bases struggled to maintain order in their own barracks. The message was clear: the oppression of Germans would no longer be tolerated. A German militia had formed outside Ramstein, determined to end the violent regime once and for all. American high-command, sensing the inevitable, quickly took whatever gold and cash they had and, in a repeat of the Nazis in the Second World War, boarded a flight to Spain, seeking refuge in the fascist Pyrenees State. As sympathetic cadets opened the gates, German forces overran the bases and tore up the command centers. After over a hundred years of American rule, The Rhineland is now German once again."

The status of the Germans will not change. He had heard this half a dozen times before, but there’s always someone else in charge, all he had to do was navigate the minefield that was ‘professionally negotiating with his superiors’.\n\n‘‘Sir, if I may, considering the urgency of the situation, would it be possible for you to direct me to whomst is in control of these affairs?‘‘\n\nUnexpectedly for Matthew, the General seemed to lean forward in his chair, rubbing the bridge between his eyes, ‘‘Look, Davis was it, I don’t know how to tell you this in the most polite terms, so I’m just going to tell you. I appreciate your ‘nobility’, but you’re not going to get anywhere with this. High command is set on ‘maintaining order at any cost’, and even if you get all the way up to Cavoli, the circumstances are just not there. Not with the situation in the north.’’\n\n‘‘You mean the massacre that happened last week, right?’’ Matthew blurted out ‘‘Or do you mean the other blood-stained protests from people who have been forced into slavery? Or-’’\n\n‘‘That is enough cadet!’’ shouted the General, sitting up in his seat, ‘‘You should be glad I’m too busy with the upcoming graduation to write you up. You are just going to have to live with how things are.’’\n\nMatthew couldn’t believe this. How could he just let all this happen under his command? Was he really okay with the status quo? ‘‘Sir, do you think the situation will change anytime soon?’’\n\n‘‘Maybe if you climb the ranks, you can change how things are done. For now though, this is the way things are, and nothing short of a change in leadership will change that.’’"

The American administration has seemingly fled the base by plane, to a more amenable state. The Germans now in charge of the Rhineland have restored the pre-war federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate, and have established a provisional government, intending to transition to a democratic republic."

The track gained an iconic status within motorsport circles, only furthered by the raceway having been made accessible to the public for Touristenfahrten, or Tourist Trips. In the aftermath of the Third World War, the trip around ‘‘The Green Hell’’ has gained an almost mecca-like status in German automotive circles, an experience that every car enthusiast must experience. Hundreds of restored pre-war cars, and new post-war constructs, each take their turn through 13 miles (or 21 kilometers) of rolling green woods. Today, however, there is just one problem... \n\n‘‘Get out of here, yous fuckin sausage eaters!’’, shouted a camo-clad man from the back of a Humvee, ‘‘It’s my fuckin day on the nur, uh, track.’’ \n\n‘‘Yeah! Get lost krauts!’’ shouted the driver, bottle in hand.\n\nA crowd started to form around the commotion, either drivers annoyed that the Americans were blocking the road, or people who just wished to see what was happening. Almost instantly, the crowd became a protest, not against the soldiers, but against the American occupation as a whole. \n\n‘‘Americans go home!’’\n‘‘Stop stealing my beer’’\n‘‘Rapists!

I would like to start with...’’\n\nJust off stage, Matthew Davis was waiting for his moment. Having figured out which cadet was being asked to give the first speech after Cavoli, he just had to wait for him to show up. Matthew struggled to contain his nerves. He rationalized his upcoming actions as ‘necessary’, that he would have done this with the nazis 300 years ago, that the system of economic oppression can only be taken down with violence, that if anyone could do it, it would be him. After all, he is an American, they won’t kill him. Right on time, the honored cadet of the ceremony walked into the backstage.\n\n‘‘Hey man, there’s been a scheduling conflict, apparently you’ve been moved back a few speeches’’\n\n‘‘You’ve gotta be joking.’’\n\n‘‘Hey, don’t take it out on the messenger, alright?’’\n\nThat seemed to work, as the ‘honored cadet’ went to go look for the manager, a tall order considering how many people seemed to shuffle in and out of the backstage. Behind the trunks of instruments and sound equipment lie a makeshift shotgun, made out of tape and plastic plumbing. Matthew put on a large coat from the costumes nearby, hoping its size will be enough to hide the gun. Was it time yet?\n\n‘‘...believe me, schooling was not easy for me. I couldn’t care less about gun maintenance or...’’ another one of Cavoli’s overly long speeches. That man never passes up an opportunity to hog the spotlight. Perhaps Matthew would be doing everyone a favor if he went out early. Matthew gave a slight chuckle to himself. God, am I really doing this? He double checked the weapon’s trigger, concerned if his wiring would work. He thought it over, like he had for weeks prior, slavery was wrong, segregation was wrong, murder was wrong. Right? Someone has to put an end to this, even if it meant-\n\n‘‘...and now, without further ado, please welcome to the stage...’’\n\nShowtime. As calmly as he could muster, Matthew stuffed the weapon into the coat, and walked up to the stage. The audience clapped, unaware. Cavoli seemed oblivious to the switcheroo, as if he didn’t even bother to check who was supposed to come out. As Matthew closed the gap, all he had to do was just act natural..."

I’m just a widdle old general in charge of a widdle old apartheid state, I did nothing to deserve this!’’\n\nInstantly, people behind the scenes started freaking out, trying to figure out how to get Cavoli off the stage.
