# Leader Stuff
XON_KHAN:0 "KHAN"
XON_KHAN_desc:0 "All khanates bow to one Khan. That is the rule in Xiongnu. The nomadic people of the north have decided that no one person is mighty enough to rule for all khanates - and so now they bow to what they call the greatest khan to grace the earth. This khan is, of course, a computer."

# Idea Stuff
XON_unhappy_chinese:0 "Unhappy Chinese"
XON_unhappy_chinese_desc:0 "The Chinese within Xiongnu have no reason to worship a mechanical monstrosity, nor endure the constant favoring the machine has towards nomads. If KHAN cannot accomodate Chinese farmers, then it may not be accomodated by them for much longer either."
XON_tuvan_separatism:0 "Tuvan Separatism"
XON_tuvan_separatism_desc:0 "Tuva was the only Khanate to refuse to bow to the KHAN, and had to be conquered with force instead. However, the KHAN fails to understand that forces in the shadows have ensured that Tuva was never truly conquered - simply waiting for an opportune time for its newest leader to take revenge."

# Focus Stuff
XON_a_thousand_blessings:0 "A Thousand Blessings"
XON_a_thousand_blessings_desc:0 "A thousand blessings upon our great KHAN. The KHAN has ruled the Confederation of 6 since its inception, and the KHAN is wise and benevolent. No man could accomplish such a thing - only a being beyond our comprehension, beyond our feeble morals and strength. KHAN is all of that and more."
XON_loyal_and_true:0 "The Loyal and True"
XON_loyal_and_true_desc:0 "Many in Xiongnu remain loyal and true to our great KHAN. We have brought together a vast array of people in the hope that we can accomplish, under KHAN, something that only one man had ever done."
XON_the_sworn_enemy:0 "The Sworn Enemy"
XON_the_sworn_enemy_desc:0 "Those in the west have no loyalty to the KHAN. They are more than just foreigners - they are outsiders, desiring to conquer a land that was never theirs to begin with. The Confederation as a whole will have something to say of that."
